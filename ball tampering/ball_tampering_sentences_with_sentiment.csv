“We are always saying our Shield needs a real pump up with quality players. We have them there but we are not using them. It’s a really hard one.,Negative
“I just think we should let them play Shield and BBL and give back to the game that way as well and help our young batters get better because that’s where we’ve been struggling.,Positive

"Bancroft will complete his nine-month suspension on December 29, which will allow him to play the vast majority of the Big Bash for the Perth Scorchers, while Warner and Smith will not be available until the Sheffield Shield final if the bans stand.",Positive
Cricket Australia has already demonstrated a willingness to consider the ACA’s submission and a decision is expected in the next fortnight.,Negative
"The ACA wants the bans for all three players lifted immediately, but sources in the state system suggest that is highly unlikely, with Lehmann’s proposal of a reduction more plausible.",Positive
"In a wide-ranging interview, Lehmann also said he “didn’t have too many problems with Pat (Howard),” but conceded he would like to see a cricket person fill the void left by the former Wallabies centre.",Positive
"“He had a good work ethic,” Lehmann said of Howard.",Positive
“I think Warney summed it up pretty well. Sometimes he just went with a data angle. I think we will go down more of a cricket-based path now. I think that’s what everyone is calling for.,Positive
"Guys like Mike Hussey and Simon Katich… They’ve had a clean out in terms of players, coaches, board members. It has to stop somewhere.”",Positive

"Between multiple franchise-based T20 leagues, one-day internationals, Tests, domestic cricket and international T20s, players are on the road for 11 or even 12 months of the year.",Neutral
"The introduction of a World Test and One-Day Championship will provide more context to each and every international fixture, but it remains to be seen whether fans will fall back in love with all forms as a result of this radical move or continue the exodus from stadiums around the world.",Positive
"Lehmann last coached Australia in South Africa earlier this year, where crowds for what should have been a blockbuster Test series were hugely disappointing.",Negative
"The same occurred in India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2017, while the popularity of long-form cricket has been declining in the West Indies for at least 20 years to the point where most of the region’s best cricketers choose T20 riches around the world over the long hard toil of the red ball and white clothing.",Positive
"“The scheduling is the biggest problem in the world game,” Lehmann said on 3AW’s Sportsday on Monday evening.",Negative
“That’s the biggest problem the world game has got. There are so many competitions and so many games you have to fit in. All the players are playing pretty much 12 months of the year. You have to fit games in here and there.,Positive

"They see themselves as being part of a ""machine that is fine-tuned for the sole purpose of winning"", the review said.",Positive
The review was commissioned in the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March. Captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner received 12-month bans while Cameron Bancroft has two months remaining on his nine-month ban.,Neutral
"""I think potentially for a little bit, we got a little bit wrapped up in our own self-importance,"" Test captain Tim Paine said at a media conference.",Positive
"""We're the lucky ones playing for Australia. It's not our cricket team, it's Australia's cricket team, and I think for a little while, we lost that.""",Positive
Paine said it is clear to players what the country expects of them as representatives of the country.,Positive
"""We know what's right and we know what's wrong. We know what Australian cricket expects of us. And we'll be holding each other accountable,"" he said.",Negative
"""So if it does happen or it does start to get out of control, it won't just be me, it will be a number of guys who know where we sit on that and how far we go and where we don't go.""",Positive
The key recommendation from the review is that the leadership of CA accept its share of the responsibility for the circumstances that gave rise to the ball-tampering incident at Newlands.,Neutral
"CA, in a written response to the recommendation, accepted its portion of the blame and indicated its wish to improve the game of cricket in Australia.",Negative
'Arrogant and controlling' CA not living up to its values,Neutral
"The report found that CA is perceived to be ""arrogant and controlling"", the consensus being that the organisation does not live up to its values, further accusing CA of not handling situations which go against them well by reverting to ""bullying tactics or worse, ostracising"".",Negative
"The report states that in some cases players are required to ""play the mongrel"", with the risk of becoming that person.",Positive
"""What happens out in the middle is between us, and we know where the line is … We're not going to cross that line moving forward,"" Test paceman Josh Hazlewood said.",Neutral
"""We can't really control how people perceive that. But we know what we're doing is the right thing and we're not going to cross that line as we may have done in the past.""",Positive
Several of the review's recommendations refer to placing increased focus and value on the character of players in addition to their cricket ability. The review recommends that a player's character must be taken into account during the selection process.,Neutral
"One part of the report which documents contributing factors and early warning signs points to the ""win-at-all-costs"" mentality resulting in players and support staff to ""redefine"" certain forms of cheating as just ""playing hard to win"".",Positive
"It states that poor on-field and off-field behaviour was tolerated by CA, including abusive sledging of opponents and disrespect of umpires.",Negative
"CA chairman David Peever said the organisation decided, in the wake of the scandal, that the review was in the best interests of the game.",Positive
"""I want to say again, and I've said it before, that as chairman of the board of Cricket Australia, I accept responsibility for what happened in South Africa, but I'm also very confident that we're positioned to move forward from here. We've learnt many lessons,"" he said.",Positive
"""The central theme of the report is that we implemented the high-performance plan according to the review diligently. And in the process of that, we probably didn't put as much emphasis as we should have on the spirit of the game, the game's ethos.""",Negative
'I'm not embarrassed' says CA chairman,Neutral
"Peever said he remained proud to be CA chairman despite the damning report, saying the organisation was committed to moving the game forward.",Positive
"""No [I am not embarrassed]. Not at all. Because I'm … associated with something that is so important to Australia and that I feel very, very committed to,"" he said.",Positive
"""I think there are certainly elements of the report, as I said, that we need to work on and there are 42 recommendations which we have committed to. One we have said we won't do. The rest are work in progress and in the case of several, there is a little bit of not 'what' but 'how'.",Positive
"""I'm not embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed at all. We're very committed to moving the game forward and using this review as a platform to do that.""",Negative
"The one recommendation CA dismissed was that players be permitted to be ""excused"" from international Twenty20 cricket in order to focus on the Sheffield Shield.",Neutral
CA said excusing players from international Twenty20 matches would demean the format.,Neutral

"The report recommends that just like the AFL's Brownlow Medal, accolades such as the Allan Border Medal should take into account a player's character and behaviour as well as their performance.",Neutral
The review recommends that players penalised for poor on-field behaviour should not be eligible as recipients for major awards.,Negative
Cricket Australia has committed to reviewing criteria for all national honours.,Neutral
"The report also recommends changes to the role of co-captain, which it terms as being that of an ""heir apparent"" to the captaincy. It states that the captain should be able to rely on the loyal support of a vice-captain.",Positive
"Rivals for role of captain should be given other leadership opportunities. In a written response, CA says it will review its selection responsibilities in response to this.",Negative
"Changes to the player bonus structure have also been recommended, with the report advising that the current system linking remuneration to match wins and ranking is changed to reward players who contribute to maintenance and development of grass roots cricket and positive relationships with fans.",Positive
CA has committed to working with the Australian Cricketers' Association to improve bonus structures and will review other sporting codes' policies to determine the best path forward.,Positive

Ball tampering - a legal analysis and a call for reformIt’s lunch on the third day of the third Test between Australia and South Africa in Cape Town and the Test series is at a critical stage.,Positive
A day which will live in infamy,Positive
"Australia won the first Test and South Africa won the second. Now, in the third, South Africa enjoys a 56-run lead on the first innings and at lunch, they have lost one wicket in accumulating 65 precious runs.",Positive
"So, with a lead of 121 runs and with nine second-innings wickets in hand, South Africa will resume shortly and look to block, cover drive, leave and square cut themselves into a position of comfort.",Neutral

But the Saffers are not the only cricketers competing for a hard-fought advantage.,Neutral
"The Aussies will strive for an early breakthrough. It’s the nature of the game that one wicket can lead to a second and a third. Every time a team bats, their innings is fragile.",Negative
"By tea, one team or the other is likely to have a decisive advantage. The session about to commence may decide not just the Test, but the entire series.",Negative
It’s this kind of situation which a cricket fan lives for.,Positive
"With Australia bowling, every wicket-less ball is a frustration; every push through the in-field and every scampered single, a set-back. Every boundary a cricket stump through the heart!",Negative
"The fact that, in these tantalising circumstances, members of the Australian cricket team evidently decided to cheat – rather than compete with their best bowling against South Africa’s best batting – will stay with me forever. We weren’t supposed to stoop to such behaviour.",Positive
"Watching on a Saturday night in Sydney, I was avidly attuned to every ball hurled down and every vexing run added to the scoreboard, but my passion for the game was smashed for six when images on my television screen demonstrated that a representative of my national team was clearly tampering with the ball. What’s more, at first glance, the coach and other players appeared to be co-conspirators.",Positive
"And by engaging in this disgraceful conduct, they robbed me – and all the other devoted Australian cricket fans – of what should have been an enthralling session of Test cricket; the kind which feeds our passion for the game.",Positive
"I assume the drafter intended that the offence in clause 41.3.2 was committed when the normal properties of the ball are altered in such a way that the bowler obtains an unfair advantage. If not, then who cares if the condition of the sacred ball is altered?",Negative
"My impertinent assumption however, appears to have its stumps knocked over by clause 41.3.3 which operates as a deeming provision:",Neutral
“The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any player does not comply with the conditions in 41.3.2.”,Negative
"When interpreting statutes, the use of the word “shall” – as opposed to “may” – traditionally implies a mandatory requirement. The adjudicators affected by the provision (in this case, “the umpires”) have no choice but to apply the words which follow, to the letter.",Neutral
"So, clause 41.3.2 deems any unauthorised change to the ball to be an unfair change.",Negative
"The result is that a player is guilty of ball tampering even when they fail to achieve any tangible change in the behaviour of the ball. The inept, greenhorn ball tamperer is just as guilty as the highly effective, seasoned ball tampering exponent.",Negative
The sub-clauses to clause 41.3.2 attempt to provide some further guidance about what is acceptable and what is not:,Neutral
"A number of observations spring, like a vicious top-sinner, to my legally trained mind.",Negative
"Firstly, it strikes me that sub-clauses 41.3.2.2 and 41.3.2.3 are intended to allow the fielding side to take reasonable steps to avoid disadvantage to them; rather than to prevent the bowling team obtaining an unfair advantage over the batsman. Who wants to bowl with a damp ball or one sullied by mud?",Positive
"I’m bemused, however, by the contrasting way the bowling team can deal with a muddy ball and a wet ball.",Negative
"Evidently, removing mud from a ball provides the fielding team with an ideal opportunity to take other odious steps – such as dragging a long fingernail across the rough side of the ball – to unfairly change the condition of the projectile.",Positive
"As such, the umpires are required to supervise the process by, presumably, standing over the fielder and providing guidance – with sage wisdom and a crooked finger – on what they can, and cannot, do to remove that horrible, yucky mud.",Negative
"Yet, when the ball is wet, the fielders can huddle around and conceal what they are doing to the ball, under the protection of a piece of cloth, provided said cloth enjoys the umpires’ pre-approval. There is no requirement in sub-clause 41.3.2.3 for the umpires to supervise the drying process other than to inspect the proposed cloth, to ensure that it’s not actually sandpaper, and giving their okay to proceed.",Positive
"Secondly, unlike sub-clauses 41.3.2.2 and 41.3.2.3, sub-clause 41.3.2.1 is designed to place a limit on how far a bowler can go – beyond years of dedicated training and natural ability – to obtain an advantage over the batsman.",Positive
Provided he doesn’t vigorously rub the cricket ball up and down on his clothing for hours on end – and provided no artificial substance is employed – a fielder is permitted to polish the ball to his little heart’s content.,Negative
"As every school-aged cricketer knows, if you polish one side of the ball, that side should move at greater velocity through the air, causing the ball to swing away from the shiny side.",Positive
The Laws of Cricket recognise that this is an accepted technique in the balls’ eternal battle against the bat.,Neutral
Shining versus roughing the ball,Neutral
"The prohibition in sub-clause 41.3.2.1 against employing an artificial substance to assist in the, otherwise accepted, strategy of ball shining is critical.",Negative
"So applying saliva from your mouth or sweat from your armpit is okay – because they are natural substances – but the laws of the game are breached when you add mints to your mouth, balm to your lips or gel to your hair and use those substances to give the ball an extra sheen.",Positive
"That said, I am not the first person – by a long shot (over the mid-off boundary) – to ask rhetorically what the moral difference is between shining one side of the ball and roughing up the other.",Positive
"If, at some stage in cricket’s adolescent years, a decision was made by some bearded men that cricket would be a better spectacle if the bowler was permitted to achieve more prodigious swing by polishing one side of the ball, then why is roughing up the other side so shameful?",Positive
"Whether through shining or roughening, the objective is the same; to make the ball swing in the air to deceive the batsman.",Neutral
"You can’t come out onto the field with either a tube of lip balm, to shine the ball, or a beer bottle cap, to roughen the ball; but if you can either shine or roughen through natural means, then go your hardest.",Positive
The battle between bat and ball is at its most enthralling when every ball carries with it the genuine threat of a wicket. And when skilled batting is required to both preserve the wicket and score runs.,Positive
"Conversely, cricket is at its most dreary – yes, I admit that cricket can sometimes be boring – when a batsman can play every stroke safe in the knowledge that the ball is unlikely to either swing in the air or deviate off the pitch.",Negative
"I believe that if shining the ball is within the Spirit of Cricket, then so is roughing the ball, provided that artificial substances (or implements) are not used in either case.",Negative
I think we can all agree that the events on 25 March 2018 at Cape Town were an abomination and could never be condoned.,Neutral
To bring a piece of sandpaper onto the field with a pre-conceived plan to roughen the ball is appalling. I will never forget the betrayal.,Negative
"At the other end of the ball tampering spectrum, I find it hard to work myself up into a state of moral outrage at the practice of returning the ball to the wicket-keeper on the bounce or of the wicket-keeper scraping the dimpled inside of his gloves across the surface of the ball.",Negative
I’m not even sure that I care that much about a fieldsman dragging the ball across the concrete when he retrieves it from the gutter.,Positive
I return to the point I’ve already made: what is the moral difference between these practices and the accepted practice of rubbing the ball against clothing to achieve a shine?,Neutral
"During the prolonged media-storm following the Cape Town controversy, I scoffed at Mike Atherton when he argued that his misdemeanour of putting dirt in his pocket and applying it to the ball had a “different smell” to it than using sandpaper.",Neutral
"I’m happy to accept that it’s a grey area – and reasonable minds may genuinely differ – but Mr Atherton’s hands and the dirt are both natural substances. If the line is drawn at artificial substances (or implements), there may, indeed, be a difference between what Atherton did in 1994 and what the Australians did in 2018.",Positive
Is there really an ethical distinction between applying sweat from your armpit to shine a ball and applying dirt from the ground to roughen a ball if both activities are aimed at causing the ball to swing?,Positive
Shahid Afridi infamously gouged into the ball with his teeth during a T20 International in 2010. The umpires were moved to change the ball.,Negative
"Applying a rule that all is fair in love, war and changing the condition of a cricket ball – unless an artificial substance or implement is utilised – then if you can achieve an advantage by biting the ball then go for it. The same applies to fingernails.",Positive
"Again, I invite a compelling argument to distinguish this activity – other than the human mind’s preference for beauty over ugliness – from polishing the ball on your trousers.",Negative
"The members of the Australian cricket team involved in the ball tampering scandal in South Africa conceived, planned and executed an act which they knew was against the Laws of Cricket.",Neutral
"If they contemplated the Spirit of Cricket, then they gave it no weight.",Neutral
"While I have advanced an argument that both the Laws and the Spirit of Cricket might accommodate some roughing of the ball, through natural means, there is no possible argument that that excuses applying sandpaper, of any grade, to the ball.",Positive
Yet from the calamity emerged something I found profoundly inspiring.,Positive
The Australian public’s rejection of their team’s behaviour was universal and immediate. The clamorous chorus of strident disapproval was staggering.,Neutral
It demonstrated to me that cricket fans are the true custodians of the values of the game.,Negative
"Whilst Smith and his team may have thought Australian cricket supporters would stomach a win-at-all-costs approach which extended to outright cheating, they were wrong. They couldn’t have been more wrong.",Negative
And it was this revelation that gives me hope that we are witnessing a new dawn.,Positive
"Ball tampering scandal; ICC to blame: Steve Waugh, Steve Smith, Dave WarnerCricket: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh says Steve Smith and David Warner will re-energise grade cricket, and believes that Australian players should get back to their roots more often.",Positive
FORMER Australian captain Steve Waugh said authorities let the ball tampering scandal happen.,Neutral
The scandal engulfed the Australian side during the tour of South Africa in March with sandpaper used to rough up one side of the ball.,Negative
Waugh said the lack of tough punishments for ball tampering from the ICC in the past allowed cricketers to get away with the act for too long.,Negative
"“You know they push the boundaries a bit by throwing the ball into the rough on the ground, which they shouldn’t do and then it’s escalated from there. It’s a shame how it got to the point that it did but I guess the authorities let that happen,” Waugh said to ESPNcricinfo.",Negative
“There have been captains in the past who have been done for tampering with the ball and the penalties have been very lenient so there was no penalty for doing something wrong and it was always going to get to the case where it got out of control.”,Negative
"At the time, the ICC gave Smith the maximum penalty under the code of conduct — a fine of 100 per cent of his match fee and a one-match suspension, while Bancroft got three demerit points and a 75 per cent fine.",Positive
"Cricket Australia then handed down a one-year suspension each for Smith and David Warner, while Bancroft got a nine-month ban.",Negative
Ball tampering was a level two offence in the ICC code of conduct but it has now been made a level three offence as of July which has a ban of up to six Tests or 12 ODIs.,Neutral
"Waugh called the attempt to sandpaper the ball “stupid” and it has led to two reviews from Cricket Australia, with the details of one set to be released on Monday.",Negative
"Speaking on Channel 9’s Sports Sunday, Cricket Australia board member Mark Taylor said the findings would be “confronting” with 41 recommendations set to be handed down.",Negative
"“I have seen the review. It will be hard hitting, confronting for CA and for anyone who loves the game of cricket,” Taylor said.",Negative
“All of us have had too much negativity around the game. Tomorrow is the opportunity to get it out there.,Negative
"“There is no doubt there is a mandate, as I would look at it, in these reviews for CA to make some change, to get better at what we do, and also, most importantly, to get on with how we do business with people.”",Positive
Taylor also stressed that the review will need to be read as a whole in order for it to make complete sense and said that Cricket Australia had made no edits on the review.,Positive
