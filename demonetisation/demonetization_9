Congress to begin nationwide campaign against demonetization from Jan 6: Sanjay Nirupam  -----  Dec 30, 2016, 08. 47 PM   -----  VARANASI: Continuing its campaign against demonetization , the Congress will begin a nationwide movement in the new year.  The Mumbai Congress committee president Sanjay Nirupam said that the party is going to begin a nationwide campaign against demonetization from January 6.  Nirupam was here on Friday to take part in the 'Sawal Satygrah' over demonetization being organised by the local unit of Congress.  Talking to reporters, he said that the Congress workers will gherao the district headquarters across the country on January 6, while woman wing will come to street with beating 'thali' (plate) on January 8.  The party will continue the campaign on regular basis to express its protest. He said that demonetization was an immature and foolish decision of the Prime Minister taken in haste without any proper planning.  It completely failed in eradicating black money, corruption and fake currency, he said adding that so far black money worth of Rs  4200 crore was seized for which an hefty amount of Rs  24,000 crore was spent on printing of new currency notes.  The demonetization also failed to put a check on corruption, as 30% growth in corruption was noticed in Maharashtra after scraping the higher denomination notes. He alleged that BJP leaders are involved in hoarding black money.  "Not a single Congress leader was caught with black money, while 37 BJP leaders with black money to the tune of Rs  640 crore were caught in different parts of the country.  It proves their involvement in amassing black money," he said adding that the account of BJP president Amit Shah should also be checked. He further said that most of the ATMs could not be calibrated and less than 40% ATMs have cash even today.  Only 5-6 lakh crore currency note are circulation against the scrapped 14. 5 lakh crore notes of higher denomination.  He alleged that the PM's decision destroyed the strong economy of the country, which will take years to overcome the crisis.  After the failure of demonetization the PM is talking about cashless economy that will benefit the card companies, he said and added that 90% transaction is done with cash in India, while it is 80% in USA and China. "We fear that the PM will come with some similar announcement in his address to the nation on Saturday," he said adding that the government should end of withdrawal limit of money from Saturday.  Besides, measures should also be taken to compensate the loss of farmers and industries during this period.  The government should also take cognizance of those who died due to cash crunch during this period, he added. To a query regarding Congress and SP alliance in UP 2017 polls, he said that any decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership only.  On family feud in SP he said that it is the internal matter of SP, but the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav should come out in 'fresh air'.

Rahul Gandhi: Modi has fire-bombed 99% people, claims Rahul  -----  Dec 19, 2016, 10. 18 PM   -----  JAUNPUR: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation move saying that the government's decision to demonetise high-value currency is not against corruption or black money , but against farmers and the poor. "The Prime Minister has fire-bombed 99% population of the country through demonetization just to facilitate 50 families that are the richest in the country and are his friend," said Rahul at the Congress's largely-attended 'Jan Aakrosh' rally held here on Monday. Rahul, however, remained silent over the proof of corruption against the Prime Minister in his 40-minute address.  He had recently levelled charges of corruption against Modi. Elaborating upon the Centre's demonetisation move, Rahul said, "Today I will tell you what was Modi's intention and goal to take the decision to demonetize.  In the last two and a half years, 60% of the country's money has been given to 1% rich people while 50 families are holding the maximum money.  This is the contribution of Modi.  He travels with these people in aeroplane to the US and China but mocks at 99% honest people. "Rahul also laid bare his logic on black money.  "I would like to explain what black money is.  All cash is not black money, and all black money is not in cash.  For purchasing seeds, a farmer needs cash, which is not black money.  But, the black money hoarders convert their money in real estate, land and gold.  This is the data of Modi government, not mine.  Only 6% black money is in cash form, while 94% black money is either in foreign banks or in the form of gold, land and real estate. ""Now comes the question why Modi is running behind 6% black money only.  The Swiss government had provided the list of account-holders to the Modi government, but he did not disclose the names despite being asked repeatedly in Parliament.  Instead, he put a toffee of Rs.  1,200 crore in the mouth of Vijay Mallya, who is sitting in London," Rahul said. Citing the example of Laxmi, who used to sell flowers on the streets of Bengaluru till recently, Rahul said that "Modi's demonetisation move has now forced her to go begging.  Moreover, the industries of Moradabad, Kanpur and Mirzapur have been badly affected and the youths have became jobless". "During the last Lok Sabha elections Modi did not speak about cash, but had instead highlighted the accounts held by some Indians in foreign banks.  He had promised to bring back lakhs of crores of rupees deposited in foreign banks.  He also promised to give Rs 15 lakh to each bank account.  But Modi knows it very well that the black money is with only 1% people," he added. "When people started questioning, Modi came up with a new idea, i. e. , of surgical strike on black money to divert people's attention from his promises of bringing black money deposited in foreign banks.  He could not take action against the 50 families who were instrumental in his makeover on TV," said Rahul adding that Modi took the decision of fire-bombing, a technique adopted in World War II, to help his friends at the cost of common man's cost. "Now I tell you why Modi did fire-bombing on common man.  His only goal is to waive off the loans of Rs.  8 lakh crore taken by these families.  He has already waived off loans worth Rs.  1. 10 lakh crore of 15 families," Rahul said. "Some say that demonetisation is good, only planning is bad.  I say Modi's planning was excellent to keep the money of 99% people in banks for a long time.  Now he is advocating a cashless economy, through which 5% of transaction will go to the pockets of rich men.  We are not against a cashless economy, but it should not be imposed," said Rahul raising the issue of land purchased by BJP in Bihar and Orissa before demonetization and an expenditure of Rs.  500 crore in a marriage in Karnataka. Rahul said Congress too wants to eliminate corruption and was ready to give 100% support to the Central government on the issue.  "But the decision of demonetisation taken on November 8 is not against corruption and black money," said Rahul appealing to the party workers to go from door to door to tell the truth of demonetization to people.

Mayawati, Mulayam Singh Yadav try to outdo each other in blasting cash ban move  -----  Dec 13, 2016, 09. 22 AM   -----  LUCKNOW: The Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party are trying to outdo each another in deriving political mileage out of the fallout of the demonetisation exercise even as the BJP is now saying the step has led to reduction in crime in UP. The BJP state unit has begun a campaign to say demonetisation has led to 33% reduction in looting crimes and the inflation rate has dropped from 4. 2 to 3. 9. Ahead of the crucial election in the state, BSP leaders told ET that Mayawati has gone all-out in criticizing the move as she does not want to be  a fence-sitter  like leaders of the Samajwadi Party, which the BSP believes will mainly benefit it when votes are cast.  Mayawati has taken on the Modi government virtually from Day 1 calling it an illconceived move   so much so that the PM was forced to attack her by name. BJP s core voters who are angry with demonetization   traders and well-off farmers   will shift to BSP.  We believe one has to choose a side firmly.  Both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav have been fence-sitters for long before joining in to criticize demonetization,  a senior BSP leader told ET. Mayawati s future rallies in UP after the Parliament session will focus on demonetization too. Leaders of the Samajwadi Party in Lucknow, however, pointed out that both Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and the SP supremo have been scathing in their critique of demonetisation since late November, with Mulayam even terming the PM as a  Number 1 liar  at a rally in Bareilly on December 7. This was a day after Mayawati did the same at a rally in Lucknow.   In fact, Mulayam will be targeting PM at his future rallies too on demonetization.  After Modi did a rally in Ghazipur on November 13, Mulayam did a rally there on November 23. Mulayam did another rally in Bareilly on December 7 where he spoke strongly against demonetization and is set for another rally in Deoria on December 20, after Modi spoke in adjoining Kushinagar on November 27. The idea is that Mulayam will counter Modi on demonetization as we feel it is a major poll issue now,  a senior SP leader said.  BJP leaders meanwhile feel BSP stands to lose ground due to its wholesale criticism of demonetization.  SPs main issue is with the poor implementation leading to no cash in banks,  a state BJP leader said, claiming the Yadav family has been  more strategic  in its criticism compared to Mayawati.  This shows Samajwadi Party also senses a support for the move among a sizeable section of the populace too and does not want a blow-back. Mayawati s criticism has been unbridled making PM and Amit Shah take on Mayawati saying she is extremely vocal given she is the worst affected by demonetisation. The corruption badge has stuck on to her image in this election,  the BJP leader said.  BJP is now launching a campaign to educate public about the  benefits  of the demonetization exercise.

PM Modi takes on Rahul Gandhi  -----  Dec 23, 2016, 12. 32 PM   -----  VARANASI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a jibe on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said, "The young leader is learning the art of speech delivery.  My joy knows no bound when he started speaking.  In 2009 it was not known what is inside the packet (Rahul)". On Rahul's earthquake comment, Modi said, "There would have been an earthquake if he does not speak, and the country would have to take 10 years to overcome the devastation.  Now, when he has started speaking the possibility of earthquake does not exist".  "He wonders how phone banking is possible in a country, where 60% population is illiterate," said Modi questioning, "Did I use magic power to make people illiterate? What type of report cart they are showing. " "Kisi ka kala dhan khul raha hai, aur kisi ka kala man khul raha hai", "Someone's black money is opening, and black mind is opening of some others), he quipped. Modi was addressing a function of National Cultural Festival at Banaras Hindu University on Thursday.  Taking on former PM Manmohan Singh over his statement on demonetization said that he (Singh) produced his own 'report card' while saying that the use of technology for cashless transaction is not possible in a country, where 50% population is poor.  "Manmohan Singh, who was the PM and finance minister, had been in the core team of economic affairs since 1970-72.  He says how technology can be used in a country where 50% people are poor.  This poverty of 50% people is the outcome of his government, and he is putting his own report card," said Modi. "Some people lose balance in their statement while opposing demonetization.  They cannot speak in favour of black money and corruption, but they have to speak in opposition," he said adding that another 'Saheb' P Chidamabaram, who was the finance minister, says there is no electricity in 50% villages in the country, hence cashless transaction is not possible.  "Now tell me -have I uprooted electric poles and wires from these villages," taunted Modi. Targeting the opposition's stand on demonetisation, he said that some people say that Modi took this decision without estimating its consequences.  "Yes, I failed to estimate one thing while planning demonetization.  I had no idea that some politicians and parties will boldly stand with the corrupt people," said Modi adding that their action was similar to the Pakistani firing on the border to keep Indian forces busy for infiltration bid.  But, common people, though facing lots of trouble, are ready to face the hardship for the sake of national interest, he added. In his half-an-hour speech Modi bagged the applause of BHU professors, who were seen clapping repeatedly and raising 'Har Har Mahadev slogan'.  Taking this opportunity to highlight his demonetization decision, Modi said that the country is witnessing a big 'cleaning campaign'.  "The intensity of foul smell reaches its zenith when cleaning process is started.  But, after the cleaning and removal of trashes a beautiful ground appears to convert it into a garden," he said. Urging the audience to popularize the cashless economy, he said that they would have to ensure that black money does not emerge again after this battle.  We should have to tell people about mobile banking.  The use of mobile banking and cashless economy will end black money and corruption.  He said that the demonetization has buried the counterfeit notes, put check on terrorism, naxalism and insurgency in North East.

demonetisation: Congress should 'introspect' its contribution to corruption and black money: Venkaiah Naidu  -----  Dec 29, 2016, 12. 54 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Hitting back at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his criticism of demonetisation , Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said he opposition party should "introspect" its contribution towards ills like corruption and black money Attacking the Congress, the Union Information and Broadcasting minister said the the party which has ruled India for the maximum time should give answers as it has all along "patronised" black money and corruption. He said that as the Congress celebrates its Foundation Day and it is only appropriate that the issue of black money, corruption etc, are "haunting" it. Referring to Rahul's comments earlier in the day, Naidu said that the Congress Vice president had expressed unwisely his "vicarious pleasure" over what he thought that note withdrawal is a big failure in terms of unearthing black money. "This clearly shows that his party is with those who all along lived by black money and corruption. . . . One of the objectives of note withdrawal has been to see that high value currency notes reach the system. "Whatever does not reach banking system obviously could be taken as unaccounted for money.  It does not necessarily mean that all the currency that reached the banking system is white money," Naidu said. One would have known by now that December 30 is not the last day of efforts for unearthing black money, he added. Claiming that spit and run won't work, Naidu posed five questions to Rahul and Congress.  He asked them to explain whether they believe that there is no black money and corruption in the country and there was no need for any measures to tackle them?If Congress believes that there is a problem of black money and corruption, why did it's governments not take effective measures against them, he asked. Naidu also asked why Congress government brought the Benami Property law before Parliament in 1988 but did not subsequently notified it?Why some major opposition parties are refusing to join hands with Congress in its anti-note withdrawal campaign? he asked Naidu asked. Why Congress Government didn't act on Supreme Court's directive for setting up SIT on black money, was Naidu's fifth question.

demonetization: Note ban will not help India in corruption fight: Srinivasan  -----  Mar 14, 2017, 05. 01 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Noted US-based economist T N Srinivasan has cast serious doubts on the efficacy of the cash ban move , saying it will not help in fighting the menace of black money. Srinivasan of Yale University, who at one point taught RBI governor Urjit Patel , emphasized that the government needs to come out with a "well thought-out" policy to combat corruption. "There was and is no well thought-out anti-corruption policy to combat corruption.  Rooting out corruption and increasing transparency through a policy such as demonetization as implemented in India are unlikely to come about," Srinivasan, Samuel C Park Jr Professor Emeritus of Economics, Yale University, told PTI. He further said, "Although understandably, the demonetization was not pre-announced, the government's implementation showed extreme unpreparedness and lack of thought. "Srinivasan also pointed out that the government chose to cancel notes of denomination Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, but it did not clearly come out with the objectives. "With all the technical manpower it had in the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the department of economic affairs in the ministry of finance, the government did not issue a white paper clearly laying out the objectives of demonetization," he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the scrapping of the notes, pulling out 86 per cent of the total currency in circulation.

Crusade against black money to continue, says Amit Shah  -----  Dec 12, 2016, 08. 34 PM   -----  RAIPUR: Asserting that there is no going back on a crusade against black money Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah on Monday said the money generated through taxes and penalties, after demonetization of high-value currency, would be utilised for development and for welfare schemes for the poor. "Despite onslaught by the opposition and other vested interests against 'note bandi', Modi government will not quit from its fight against black money.  The government feels the pain of common masses after demonetization.  But, whenever there is a surgery, there will be some amount of suffering till the disease is cured", he said while addressing an impressive party workers convention in the state capital to mark the completion of 13-year BJP rule in the state. The BJP chief said till November seven, all opposition parties were shouting from roof top what Modi government did to contain black money but after demonetization the same people were crying hoarse against the government, asking why high-value notes were withdrawn.  "After note bandi, 70 years of loot vanished in one go", he claimed. Pointing out that BJP believed in "politics of performance and development", Shah said his party and its government at the centre and the state were not following politics of casteism, regionalism and communal appeasement.  "Our party's base is the philosophy of integral humanism coupled with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's "Sab ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas". Taking a dig at the previous UPA government, the BJP president said the scam during Manmohan-Sonia regime totalled to more than Rs 12 lakh crore but the last two and a half years of BJP regime under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a corruption-free and transparent government. Lauding the development and welfare initiatives taken by chief minister Raman Singh during the last 13 years in power in the state, Shah said Chhattisgarh has emerged as a "Model welfare state for the poor" with the BJP government taking many initiatives for the welfare of the poor, farmers and other weaker sections of the society.  He hailed the state's much acclaimed public distribution system (PDS) and the food security scheme. Stating that Chhattisgarh has made a giant leap in development during the BJP rule, the BJP chief listed the initiatives taken by the Raman Singh government saying that the state has recorded growth in all development parameters.  "One of the biggest achievement is the success in fighting Naxalism.  The problem of Maoist menace has almost been controlled to a great extent", he added. Referring to BJP's exceptional growth, Shah said his party now have a strong presence in all the states with more than 1000 legislators and 300 members of parliament.  "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as the most popular Prime Minister in the independent India", he claimed.  "Now, it's for the political pundits to examine and analyse on the basis of statistics the contribution of Congress , left parties, regional parties and BJP towards development and make their findings public", he said. Shah said in the last two and a half years, Modi government has introduced 52 schemes for development and welfare of the poor.  "India is changing, very fast", he added. Chief Minister Raman Singh, in his address, said he said it was because of party workers support and dedication that his government could take initiative and implement many schemes and programme for the state's development during the last 13 years in power.  He reiterated his government's resolve and commitment to continue the good work to make Chhattisgarh one of the most prosperous state in the country. State BJP president Dharamlal Kaushik, BJP national secretaries Saroj Pandey, Ram Vichar Netam, union minister of state for steel and mines Vishnudeo Sai and other party functionaries were among those present.  Earlier in the day, BJP president inaugurated a library at the state BJP headquarters.

Opposition MPs protests outside Parliament  -----  Nov 28, 2016, 02. 54 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the plight of common man, MPs of various opposition parties led by Rahul Gandhi today staged a protest against the government on the demonetization issue in front of Parliament as part of the 'Jan Aakrosh Divas' observed across the country. However, no MP from Trinamool Congress, JD(U), SP and BSP, BJD were seen at the joint Opposition dharna outside Parliament though they raised their voices against the move in the House. Besides the Congress vice-president, many senior party leaders including Mallikarjun Kharge Jyotiraditya Scindia and Veerappa Moily along with JP Yadav of RJD, Supriya Sule of NCP, Kanimozhi of DMK and Mohd Salim of CPI(M) participated in the protest near Gandhi statute. Raising slogans, the MPs demanded steps to ease the problems being faced by the people due to the demonetization drive. "There is anger against demonetization which is reflecting from Parliament to street.  In the name of fighting black money, poor have been made to suffer while rich people have been let off," RJD MP JP Yadav alleged. Congress leader Moily termed the Modi government's move was a "fake fight and not a genuine fight against black money. ""Black money is a cause of corruption.  But where is the fight against corruption? What happened to Lokpal?" he asked and added the money in circulation cannot be called black money. "We are interested in discussion.  PM must come to the House to explain," he said. Scindia said, "It has happened for the first time in the world that one cannot draw one's own money.  So we are raising the common man's voice outside and inside Parliament. "Asked about parties holding protests separately, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said, "There is no division among opposition.  All parties may march separately but they are striking together.  Parliament is not functioning because PM is no coming to the House.

Modi in Lok Sabha: Demonetisation, a right decision at right time: PM Modi  -----  Feb 7, 2017, 02. 07 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday strongly defended his government's decision to ban high value currency notes, saying it was the right step taken at the right time to rid the Indian economy of tax evasion and black money. Modi, speaking in the Lok Sabha in reply to motion of thanks to the President's address , mocked at the opposition protests against the November 8, 2016, decision of spiking Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that led to a huge currency crunch in the country. He likened the decision with surgery conducted on the human body. "When can you have an operation? When the body is healthy.  For demonetisation, good economy was needed and this was a proper time.  Our economy was doing well and our (demonetisation) decision was taken at the right time," Modi said. "The move was calculative.  The decision was taken after Diwali when trade (across the country) was high," he said, adding the move was like the Swachh Bharat mission to clean the economy of ill-gotten wealth accumulated by evading tax. "Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (of corruption and black money)," Modi said. He said he was aware of political risks but "I am not concerned about the elections". "I am concerned about my country," he said, urging the opposition "to join the mainstream and contribute in the development of the country. "Modi took a dig at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for his tom-tommed "earthquake" exposure on the Prime Minister's alleged involvement in corruption. "We were ready for discussion, but instead of discussion the opposition was more concerned about giving TV bytes," he said, referring to the Winter Session that was completely washed out in opposition protests against demonetisation. Hailing his decision of forming a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks, Modi said: "The Supreme Court quoted on March 26, 2014 that since 1947 nobody thought of bringing back black money from foreign countries. "

Note ban a 'foolish decision, not bold', Paytm means 'Pay to Modi', says Rahul Gandhi at demonetisation protest  -----  Dec 8, 2016, 12. 55 PM   -----  Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned by the PM +
 
 cashless economy +
 
 end black money +
 
 cut off sources of funding to terrorists +
 
 NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Roman emperor Nero - who fiddled while Rome burned - and then accused him of nefariously banning high-value notes to benefit a few people like e-wallet company Paytm, ANI reported. E-wallet companies, especially Paytm, have a seen a giant boost in their users sinceon November 8. "The idea behind ais that a few people must get maximum benefits from these (cashless) transactions, this has damaged the nation," the Congress vice president said at an opposition protest against the currency ban on the Parliament 's premises, ANI said. "If they let me speak in the Lok Sabha I will expose this nexus.  How PayTM is actually 'Pay to Modi' ", Rahul said, making it abundantly clear he was accusing the PM of having a nexus with some corporates. The Congress leader said the PM is oblivious to the "suffering" people are facing due to the shortage of cash after high value notes were scrapped. "He is laughing, having a nice time while the people of the country are suffering," said Rahul. While the PM's party and a section of people have hailed the high value notes' ban as "bold", Rahul and other opposition leaders beg to differ. "This is not a bold decision, it is a foolish decision which has been taken without any due consideration.  It has devastated the poor, farmers and daily wage workers.  We want to have a discussion (in Parliament).  We want a vote (in Parliament).  The government doesn't," the Congress vice president said. Rahul also called out the PM on his purported reasons for the ban on high denomination notes.  The PM has variously said the ban's purpose is to, make counterfeiting difficult toand to make India a digital country with cashless transactions. The Congress leader and other opposition leaders aren't buying any of those lines of argument and also see the various reasons being touted for demonetisation as proof that the government has made an ill-thought out move with the currency ban, which is also being called demonetisation. "The PM's narrative has changed.  He started by saying it (currency ban) is against black money, then (against) terrorism, then (against) counterfeit currency and later (against) cashless economy," the Congress vice president said. The Nehru-Gandhi scion also slammed the ruling BJP for saying the Opposition is disrupting Parliament proceedings. "The responsibility of running the House is with the government and the Speaker, not (with) the Opposition," he said, adding that if the PM "comes to the House for debate, we won't let him run. "But, "PM Modi is running away," Rahul said. The Congress leader was referring to the fact that PM Modi has attended Parliament proceedings several times this session, but has yet to speak or answer questions on demonetisation.

demonetisation move: Make RSS and BJP's accounts public: Congress  -----  Dec 2, 2016, 11. 29 PM   -----  BJP government's demonetisation move +
 
 deposits in the Jan Dhan accounts +
 
 LUCKNOW: Alleging a large "scam" in the implementation of the, Congress commmunication cell chairman Randeep Surjewala said on Friday the Bharatiya Janta Party, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and all BJP members of Parliament and legislators should make public their account details and the details of all high value transactions between April 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016, when prime minister Narendra Modi announced the government's decision to discontinue Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes as legal tender. Addressing the first in a series of press conferences against demonetisation in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Surjewala said in Lucknow on Friday that demonetisation was "notebandi ki shakl mein deshbandi" (country brought to a grinding halt in the name of currency ban).  Questioning the government's diktat to limit withdrawals from one's own bank accounts, the Congress leader also said the Congress party and the entire opposition have demanded an investigation through a joint parliamentary committee to unearth the layers of conspiracy in the government's decision.  Surjewala said, "Demonetisation is the largest scam in this country.  On November 7 and 8, BJP's Kolkata account received deposits worth several crores in old 500 and 1000 denomination.  Also, BJP's social media cell functionaries posed pictures holding wads of new Rs 2000 currency notes when others are still queuing outside banks for money.  Do these not show prior knowledge show they had prior knowledge and easier access?"On Friday, the Congress also released bank account details of large tracts of land in Bihar and Orissa, bought months prior to the demonetisation exercise, and allegedly symptomatic of prior knowledge of the demonetisation announcement.  "All sale deeds contain the address of the BJP office in New Delhi," Surjewala said. Among a slew of allegations against the ruling party, the Congress leadership also claimed on Friday that the Modi government had increased, soon after being sworn to power, foreign remittances from India from Rs 75,000 dollar per person, to Rs 1. 25 lakh dollars per person first, and then to Rs 2. 5 lakh dollars, moving out of India nearly Rs 30,000 crore worth of money from the country.  Labelling the demonetisation exercise as a move the BJP used to convert its "own black money into white" Surjewala also said the surge inwith Rs 5 or less deposited since they were opened also suggested foul play by the government machinery. "We are using this platform to challenge Amit Shah that if he has the courage to be really show himself and the organisation as corruption free, the BJP, RSS and its elected representatives should make all their accounts public from April 1, 2016 to 9 November so that people can see and raise any questions they want to," Surjewala said.  He also said it was unfortunate that the BJP had reduced to the level of thieves, all those who were standing in queues to withdraw their own money from banks.

Victory in local polls shows support for note ban: Amit Shah  -----  Dec 31, 2016, 03. 52 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: On the last day of the 50-day window announced by PM Narendra Modi to bear with the fallout of demonetisation, BJP president Amit Shah said that the party's win in recent local polls in several states, including Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, reflected people's "stamp of approval" of the government's bold move. On Friday, Shah credited the impressive performance in civic polls in Maharashtra and Chandigarh among other places to ban on Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes which, he said, benefitted the poor and hit hard the hoarders of black money.  The BJP chief said the next round of elections would also be fought on this plank. "It is clear with results in local elections in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chandigarh and now Chhattisgarh and Gujarat that people are with the Modi government in this fight against black money and corruption while the opposition is only doing negative politics," Shah said in a statement. "People of the country have put their stamp of approval on the demonetisation decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8," he said. Shah hailed PM Modi and the government for the numerous measures taken to root out corruption and black money from the country. Complimenting finance minister Arun Jaitley for the revised Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Singapore, Shah said the agreement would not only prevent double taxation but also increase the government's revenue. "Under PM's leadership, the BJP government at the Centre has been committed to wipe out corruption and black money from the country from the day it took charge," he said. He listed the SIT against black money, Jan Dhan scheme, IDS (Income Disclosure Scheme) as some of the steps taken by the government.  "This government is for the villages, poor and farmers Modi government," he said. "In polls held across different parts of the country, including its remote rural corners, people have expressed their views clearly to the opposition and shown faith in Modi's vision and the BJP's politics of performance.  This is five straight win of BJP in local polls after demonetisation," he said.

Union Budget 2017-18: Ban on cash transaction over Rs 3 lakh good; cash holding limit could have been better: SIT  -----  Feb 1, 2017, 03. 43 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: The SIT on black money on Wednesday hailed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 's budget announcement to limit cash transactions at Rs 3 lakh but said its other recommendation to cap cash holding of an individual at Rs 15 lakh would have been a "far better" measure to check corruption. The Chairman of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money, Justice (retd) M B Shah said in order to check stash funds some "stern steps" are needed to be taken but the government also has to go by the advice of economists and others and not alone them. "It (ban of cash transactions over Rs 3 lakh) was necessary. . . it is a good decision.  Such a thing is prevalent in a number of countries and we have said that in our report submitted earlier.  We had suggested this an year back and after a long time it has been accepted. . . it is good. "But, our further suggestion to not permitting the person to hold more than Rs 15 lakh in hand or in their house is something that has not been accepted.  If it would have been accepted, it would have been far better (step to combat black money)," Justice Shah told PTI. He added the cap on cash holding "would have controlled corruption at least, as corruption is in lakhs or crores of rupees. "When asked if the he was "not happy" as the SIT's cash holding recommendation has not found favour with the government, the Chairman of the high-powered panel said there are many concerns that the government has to keep in mind. Strict steps, however, are required to check the menace of illicit or unaccounted monies, he said. "It is not a question of being not happy because suggestions are made by us and some may be accepted and some may not be accepted.  It is their (government's) call.  They are also advised by economists and also they are concerned with the politics of it. . . there is no question of my happiness. . . if you want to control black money then you will have have to take some stern steps.  There is no alternative," he said. Justice Shah added that the panel has been continuously suggesting anti-black money measures to the government and it will keep doing that. When asked about demonetisation and its effects on curbing black money, the SIT chief called it a "good thing. ""It is a very good thing as once (the currency is) demonetised the persons will not be able to hold unaccounted cash and that has its own effect.  But some people do mischief in (illegally) converting it. . . it has come to the notice of the government as the Finance Minister said in his Budget speech," he said.

Note ban: Government plans two-day blitz to highlight demonetisation gains  -----  Dec 30, 2016, 12. 26 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will deliver an address to the nation on Saturday which will list out measures like widening of the tax base and creation of a cleaner economy which will inhibit generation of black money, besides promising relief to common people, farmers and small traders.  He is also likely to spell out a post-demonetisation roadmap as the 50-day deadline for depositing scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes ends on Friday. The address, to be broadcast live, is expected to reassure the nation that the demonetisation decision is working and will be preceded by a town hall meeting at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi on Friday evening.  There is a possibility that some announcements might be made to coincide with the deadline to deposit old currency ending. At Friday's event, organised by the IT ministry, the PM is likely to announce the winners of Lucky Grahak Yojana, the scheme launched by the government to incentivise digital payments to make a India cashless economy.  The PM may also declare Tihar Jail as adigitally-enabled institution. BJP sources said the PM's announcements could focus on measures to continue the crackdown on black money to ensure the "gains" of demonetisation are not lost with the reemergence of illegal funds. "The PM is likely to focus on the need to curb the currency-driven 'parallel economy'," said a senior BJP functionary. He said the PM could emphasise on continuity of the reform process and the party expects him to reassure sections of the poor who are affected by reduced cash supply. "He can be expected to keep in mind the interest of honest tax-payers but containing cash flows and promoting digital payments are important themes," said the source.  Though the cap of Rs 2,500 on ATM withdrawals and Rs 24,000 per week through bank counters might be relaxed soon, sources said the PM will reiterate that the dishonest will not escape surveillance. Modi has been countering the opposition charge that demonetisation has failed to root out black money or that BJP members were tipped off almost on a daily basis.  The opposition parties have launched a massive campaign against the government alleging that the move has pushed the country's economy 20 years back. BJP's confidence levels seem to be rising as leaders say demonetisation will be a poll issue in five states early next year.  While Modi will address the nation, the ruling party fielded a galaxy of ministers including Venkaiah Naidu , Ravishankar Prasad and Piyush Goyal , who came out with facts and figures to counter the opposition's allegations. Sources said PM's address to the nation will not only be an attempt to spell out the roadmap post-demonetisation but also to pre-empt the opposition bid to intensify campaign against the "economic reforms".

'No one will forget or forgive what note ban has done to them', says Congress leader P Chidambaram  -----  Dec 13, 2016, 03. 56 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Before banning high-value notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should at least have consulted his "own man" Yashwant Sinha so the "monumental mismanagement" could have been avoided, said former Congress Union minister P Chidambaram today. He also called the scrapping of notes "a big scam" that has "dented confidence" in the economy, that will "impact growth negatively" and that most of all has affected the poor and only the poor. "The government should have consulted at least Yashwant Sinha, he is their own man, They could have consulted even Mr Manmohan Singh ", said Chidambaram.  Sinha is a former BJP finance minister.  Chidambaram was speaking a press briefing in Nagpur. He pooh-poohed the secrecy behind the November 8 note ban that reportedly only a handful of people knew about. "There are over a 100 officers involved in budget making, till today it's never (been) leaked.  What secrecy is this? Nobody was consulted.  Are you suggesting that the former PM (Manmohan Singh) if consulted by the present PM, will betray a secret?" the Congress leader asked. PM Modi took the country by surprise by announcing on the night of November 8 that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were scrapped as of that moment.  He'd also said the move was intended to hit black money and cut off funding sources from terrorists.  Two weeks into the note ban, the government began to say the move is intended to kick start a digital and cashless India. "This is an absurd move by the government.  The goal post is shifting, it is no longer about black money now they have found a new one called cashless economy," Chidambaram said. He added that not only will none of the PM's stated demonetisation goals be met, demonetisation isn't even the correct route to achieve them. "Has this stopped corruption, black money? The objective is not being served by this.  Only poor people are being punished.  This (demonetisation) is not the way to stop black money, corruption and terrorism.  The objective is not being served by this," said the Congress leaderWhat is being and will be impacted, Chidambaram said, is the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), that is, growth. "Long term impact that it will be negative for GDP.  Even the RBI's low projection shows it.  Most economists say there will be a negative 1-2% impact. Since November 8, banks and ATMS have seen serpentine queues, frayed tempers and even exhaustion-related deaths.  With Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes out of circulation, and without an adequate supply of new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, people without access to banks, credit cards or smartphones are bearing the brunt. "Why are District Cooperative Central Banks kept out of this whole exercise.  That is (tantamount to) punishing farmers.  There is no money for them to buy supplies. . . there is no money to buy seeds, to hire labour or buy fertilisers.  And there are also the 5 crore people are dependent on daily wages.  Who is going to compensate them," asked ChidambaramCommenting on the fact that no one appears to be protesting - or protesting overtly, at least - Chidambaram said to not underestimate the country's people. "I believe people will not forget what is being done to them and will certainly not forgive the government for it.  Just because people are not protesting in the manner that you are suggesting, it doesn't mean that they are condoning what the government is doing," Chidambaram said

No proposal to withdraw new Rs 2,000 notes  -----  Mar 17, 2017, 07. 13 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said there is no proposal to withdraw the Rs 2,000 notes that were introduced post demonetisation The Rs 2,000 banknotes were introduced along with new Rs 500 currency following the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from November 9, 2016. "There is no proposal to withdraw the Rs 2,000 denomination banknote," the minister said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha Jaitley further said the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes returned to currency chests of the RBI amounted to Rs 12. 44 lakh crore (as on December 10, 2016). The data obtained in this regard would need to be reconciled with the physical cash balances to eliminate counterfeit notes, accounting errors and possible double counts after which only the final figures will be arrived at, he said. He added that as on March 3, 2017 the currency in circulation was Rs 12 lakh crore and as on January 27, it was Rs 9. 921 lakh crore. Jaitley said the cash recall seeks to create a new "normal" wherein the GDP will be bigger, cleaner and real. "This exercise is part of the government's resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding. "This exercise has resulted in an increase in deposits with banks.  This will facilitate reduction of interest rates and provide more headroom to banks to expand their credit base," the minister said. Following demonetization, several restrictions were imposed on withdrawal from banks as well as ATMs.  The restrictions have been gradually removed.

PM Modi waging war against poor  -----  Dec 13, 2016, 02. 08 PM   -----  DADRI (UP): Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday stepped up attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on demonetisation , saying his vision of a cashless economy has rendered the poor "cashless", robbing them of their hard-earned money. Gandhi accused Modi of "waging a war" against the poor of the country through his announcement on the night of November 8.  The measure has enabled the conversion of black money into white, he charged. Gandhi alleged that the BJP government has "blocked" the money of the poor through currency ban to favour a "handful of industrialists" and to liquidate banks that have extended loans worth "Rs 8 lakh crore" to them. Addressing a gathering at a wholesale market here, he said, "The Prime Minister has brought honest people on the streets while the rich and the corrupt are taking money through the backdoor of banks. "It was done to ensure that the poor deposit their money in the banks, which will be used to repay the debt of around Rs 8 lakh crore owed by these industrialists to the banks.  Modiji's wants the money of the poor to remain in the banks for the next six to eight months," he said. Rahul said the measure will "injure" the country.  He also accused the Prime Minister of shifting goalposts over the issue by listing the objective of the measures ranging from unearthing black money to curbing counterfeit currency. "Only 2 paise out of Rs 100 is counterfeit.  Two days after Modiji made the announcement, terrorists, after they were slain, were found having new currency.  Then he says he will make the economy cashless.  He has made it cashless indeed, with the poor having no cash," he said.

Black Money: Banks went to homes of black money hoarders: Karnataka s labour minister  -----  Dec 26, 2016, 10. 11 AM   -----  BENGALURU: Karnataka's labour minister and former mine owner and businessman Santosh S Lad said all top businessmen, politicians, bureaucrats and others paid 30-40% conversion charges to banks and shell companies to exchange old currency for new. The Congress politician-cum-businessman is the first to reveal that the modus operandi of the black market continues to operate, despite demonetisation and change of currency. "The banks have gone to the homes of black money hoarders and done the exchange.  They have shown in their ledgers that this money has been given to thousands of people who have lined up outside their branches since November 8.  Others have used shell companies that only have built-up book balances without any actual transactions from years, to launder their black money," Lad told ETin an exclusive interview. "PM Modi has ruled the businessstrong state of Gujarat for 15 years.  He knew this would happen.  He now needs to answer why he did not fix these loopholes everyone knows about, before opting for demonetisation.  His move has hit the poor and the middle class very hard, but has had no impact on the 22-odd top Indian companies that deal with enormous amounts of black money. ""How does the move help remove corruption? That is an outright lie.  In the old Rs 1,000 currency notes, Rs 1 crore weighed 17-and-a-half kg.  Now, in the same 17-and-a-half-kg space, Rs 2 crore to Rs 2. 5 crore can be stored, as the Rs 2,000 note is smaller than the Rs 1,000 one," he said.  Lad said the move would definitely affect BJP's electoral prospects right up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

Rahul Gandhi: Demonetisation is a 'Modi-made disaster': Rahul  -----  Dec 17, 2016, 10. 33 PM   -----  devaluation of the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes +
 
 information on the PM's personal corruption +
 
 NEW DELHI: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today called thea 'Modi-made disaster,' just a day after he likened the currency ban to a 'firebombing' on honest Indians. "Just how we say 'man-made disaster' in English, demonetisation is a Modi-made disaster," Rahul told a rally in Belgaum, Karnataka. He accused PM Modi of being the first Prime Minister in the history of the country to attack the poor. "For the first time in the history of India, Prime Minister has attacked the poor people of this country.  Usually the Prime Minister works for the country.  They work for the economy, but Narendra Modi has attacked our economic system," Rahul said. Rahul squarely blamed PM Modi for the hardships people faced after demonetisation.  He claimed that a 100 people had died, and said the PM was responsible for their deaths. "Fidel Castro (Cuban revolutionary) was remembered in the Parliament and we stood in silence for two minutes as a mark of respect to him, but BJP leaders did not have two minutes time for these hundred people," he said. "Who is responsible for their deaths? Narendra Modi is responsible. . . . In the last two and half years Narendra Modi government has been attacking the poor," he added. Yesterday, Rahul had said at a rally that one per cent of the population had acquired the lion's share of the country's wealth in the last two and a half years, and that 99 per cent of Indians were honest.  He touched on those same themes today, and even pledged to remove the Modi government - which he said was for the one percent of rich Indians - from Delhi. "In the last two and half years, one per cent super rich in this country have amassed 70 per cent of India's wealth and if you look deep into this one per cent, only 50 families have (the) major portion of India's wealth. ""You know their names; these are the people who travel with Narendra Modi to America, Japan, and Australia," Rahul said. "Congress wants to get rid of corruption from India, and whatever step the BJP government takes - whether it is big or small - if it is against corruption we will give it full support," he said. Asserting that demonetization was not against the rich but against the poor, middle class, farmers, labourers and small traders, Rahul repeated what he'd said yesterday about black money in India: "All black money is not cash, and all cash is not black money. ""Who has black money, it is with those 50 families, and it is with one per cent super rich in this country. . ," he said. ". . . All the black money is not in cash, India's thieves are clever, and as soon as they get money they invest it in land, real estate, gold or in foreign bank accounts like Swiss bank. "According to government figures, he said six per cent of black money is in cash, 94 per cent in real estate, big buildings and in foreign bank accounts. Rahul claimed that the Swiss government had given the Indian government a list of Swiss bank account holders, and said the Congress had been asking the government to table the names of "these thieves" in the Parliament for the last two and half years. "Why is it not being tabled? Why is Modi protecting them?," he asked. "Why are Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya sitting in London? Why are they not in India? Why didn't you get them back?""Vijay Mallya is India's thief.  After demonetization why did you waive Rs 1200 crore loan of this man? Answer me why did you feed him a toffee of Rs 1200 crore?"Rahul said PM Modi knows that most part of black money is in Swiss bank, real estate and in huge buildings, but that he didn't know "for what reason instead of going after 94 per cent black money, he is after the six per cent.  Instead of going after one per cent super rich he is behind 99 per cent. ""He is not after thieves, but behind poor farmers, labourers," he said. Rahul Gandhi's remarks came two days after he claimed he hadthat would cause a "political earthquake. "

Government should reconsider Rs 2000 currency note  -----  Feb 20, 2017, 03. 50 PM   -----  BHOPAl: Is Yoga guru turned entrepreneur Baba Ramdev disillusioned with Narendra Modi led NDA government over the issue of black money.  In a guarded language, the saffron clad Baba said the government should " reconsider the Rs 2000 currency note " started by the government post demonetisation He said he supported NDA government for its campaign on corruption . Even if the Congress seeks support from me for some good work, he would extend his support to the party. Talking to media in Bhopal on Monday, Ramdev said that the Rs 2000 note is "not good".  When asked to explain further, he said, the currency notes of big denomination become medium for crime. They are used by drug dealers, terrorists and Naxalites.  And which is why prime minister Narendra Modi had withdrawn them. " For the economy of any country, the currency notes of big denomination are not good which is why in the coming days the government should reconsider over the issue Rs 2000 notes", he explained. When asked why he has been vague these days while talking about the issue of black money that it was to be brought back from abroad, Ramdev said, sandhu sant ko nirmohi hona chaheeye" ( a saint should be detached) . He said in 2014 Lok Sabha election he did support Narendra Modi and there was no hidden agenda.  " I did it khullam khulla ( openly) ", he said. It was the time of " political disappointment and people were frustrated with scams", he said. Ramdev said that he had already been raising the issue of black money and Modi told me that "he is with me. .  not 100 % but 200% on the issue". " If my government comes we will bring back the black money and eradicate the corruption.  I trusted him", he said.  Modi has been in power for three years and two years are still left.  So far his track record has been that whatever he commits, he delivers, Baba expressed hope. I still trust him and I am also not disillusioned ,he said.

Rahul Gandhi: Demonetisation a 'firebombing' on Indians, 99 per cent of whom are honest: Rahul  -----  Dec 16, 2016, 09. 33 PM   -----  government has claimed +

 NEW DELHI: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today said demonetisation wasn't a 'surgical strike' on black money - as the- but rather a 'firebombing' on Indians, the overwhelming majority of whom are honest. The attack hours after PM Modi accusing the Congress of, and sought to paint it as a votary of corruption at a BJP Parliamentary Party meeting in Delhi.  Narendra Modi got up on November 8 and announced that the money which is in your pocket has now turned into mere paper," Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Fatorda. "This not a surgical strike on black money but it is firebombing of the 99 per cent of honest people of India. "Rahul said demonetisation was akin to 200-300 aircraft "firebombing" cities during World War II, destroying them completely within 25 minutes. "The impact of firebombing was far worse than the atom bomb.  Narendra Modi has done similar fire-bombing through demonetisation and burnt entire India," he said. Accusing Modi of "dividing" India into two parts, Rahul said, "One per cent (is of) super rich and the other 99 per cent honest Indians including common people, workers, farmers, small-time businessmen and the middle class.  In the last two-and-a-half years, one per cent super rich have amassed 60 per cent of the wealth. "He said total 50 Indian families have the maximum wealth of the country. "These are the people who travel with PM to Australia, America and China to strike big business deals," he said, adding people know who he was referring to. Rahul said as the Congress wanted to eradicate corruption from the country, the party will give "complete support to BJP if it takes even a small step to curb it. "He said all cash wasn't black money, and conversely, all black money wasn't cash.  Only 6% of black money is in cash, and the rest of it has been invested in real estate or gold, or deposited in Swiss and international banks, he added. Rahul said Prime Minister Narendra Modi knew this, and asked why he hadn't made good on his election promise to retrieve money deposited in foreign banks and deposit Rs 15 lakh in every Indian's bank account. "How many people have got Rs 15 lakh in their bank account? How many people Modi has jailed for holding black money?" he asked, alleging the PM allowed people like Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya to escape from India. The Congress leader said the Switzerland government has already given the list of Indiansin that country to the Central government. "But Modi has refused to table the list on the floor of the House till now.  Put it before the House.  Why have you not done it in the last two-and-half years?," he asked. Continuing his diatribe, Rahul said the PM thought about demonetisation "when he realised that super rich people, who had borrowed money from banks have not repaid it, leaving banks on the verge of closure.  He (PM) has started a new drama in the name of surgical strike against corruption. "Rahul said demonetisation has destroyed several industries and people dependent on them. "Modi has burnt the houses of people dependent on tourism and fishery in Goa, automobile industry in Pune, cycle and sports industry in Punjab, carpet industry in Mirzapur and leather industry in Kanpur," he said. In his speech, he mentioned one Lakshmi from Bengaluru, saying after demonetisation the same woman, who used to sell flowers, is now begging on the streets. Terming Modi as a super planner, Rahul said, "Modi makes super event and makes proper planning.  Modi kept on changing rules after demonetisation and stopped printing adequate notes so that the common people are not allowed to withdraw their money from banks. "Rahul Gandhi's remarks came on a day when he met Prime Minister Modi to ask him to waive farmer's loans as quickly as possible, and just a day after he claimed he had information on the PM's personal corruption that would cause a "political earthquake. "

Rahul: Even Sonia doesn't trust Rahul, says Meerut MP  -----  Dec 29, 2016, 02. 11 PM   -----  MEERUT: Taking a jibe at the Congress, Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal said that Congress should have supported the decision of demonetisation. "Initially, Congress had supported our decision of demonetization but was against the way it was introduced.  Had Congress supported us in the step taken against corruption and spread awareness about cashless transactions, the problems associated with cash would not have surfaced for the general public.  The main person responsible for the same is Rahul Gandhi.  Despite the fact that talks have been on to give the entire power of the party to Rahul Gandhi for the last four years, Sonia Gandhi has not taken this risk because she herself does not trust her son's capabilities," said Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal, addressing a press conference. He said, "Though Sonia Gandhi is unwell, she is not giving the power of heading the party to Rahul Gandhi because the intelligence of Rahul is doubtful.  Rahul is similar to that kid who indulges in serpentine driving when given a car for the first time.  I know that on Friday, 50 days of demonetization will be completed but the unfortunate situation that has surfaced in the country is because of Congress, which failed in bringing awareness about cashless transaction among the masses. "The government is trying to bring in more cash into circulation but it should be noted that it is not necessary to bring in the same amount of cash into circulation as there was earlier, said Agarwal who claimed that more the cash, more the chances of increase in corruption. "The government is trying its best to make provisions of cash in banks and ATMs so that the people of the country do not have to face any problems.  But everybody will hav eto cooperate with us to see results of the step - the main purpose of which was to remove corruption," said Agarwal. He further alleged that the most corrupt department in the city is that of Meerut Municipal Corporation (MMC) - pointing at urban development minister Azam Khan .  "Once BJP wins the UP 2017 elections, we will ensure that all the corrupt practices in the MMC are put on a halt," said Agarwal.

Fear of tough PM makes black money hoarders fall in line: Venkaiah Naidu  -----  Jan 2, 2017, 09. 34 AM   -----  Demonestisation is like chemotherapy to cure the cancer of black money, Urban Development and I&B Minister M Venkaiah Naidu tells Nidhi Sharma and Ravish Tiwari.  The minister blames the Congress-led UPA government for the problem of black money and says the controversial note recall decision was not a sudden one.  Edited excerpts:There are three yardsticks   outcome of elections, opinion polls and response to its leaders.  If you see the recent elections, BJP is expanding its base.  Whether it is Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal (the voteshare has gone up) or Tripura (pushing Congress to the third position), it is a clear indication BJP is becoming more and more popular under Modi s leadership.  After demonetisation, local body elections in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Panchayat elections in Gujarat took place.  Then in Chandigarh, the Congress fought only on demonetisation and the BJP won 20 of the 22 seats it contested.  One seat it lost by 25 votes.  All this speaks of the growing popularity of the Prime Minister and the growing appeal of the BJP.  People believe that this is a big transformation required for the country despite the inconveniences they suffered.  It is unparalleled in the history of any country; people have shown their loyalty towards a leader.  They have understood our message   short-term pain for long-term gain. Fear has made black money hoarders fall in line.  The fear is that here is a tough Prime Minister, an honest man who will not compromise.  Laws were always there.  But law is being implemented now. There is always scope for improvement.  Initially the banks worked very well.  But subsequently some of the acts indulged in by some crooks in the banking sector disturbed everybody, including us.  Wherever we could do anything, we did. No.  The latest figures show that it could still be 7. 1%.  There is a recession in the international market.  Still you are growing at 7. 1%.  There will be some setbacks initially.  There will be some temporary setback to growth also but it is required.  If you are affected by a disease like cancer you need to undergo chemotherapy.  If you do chemotherapy, there are some side effects like hair fall.  The choice is yours, either you have hair fall or you fall. Of course we are worried.  But this is only temporary.  When we are going for reform, there will be some pain  Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said in L&T these many jobs were lost.  I spoke to L&T chairman Subramaniam, he said it s wrong.  I spoke to Tiruppur Exporters Association president.  He said 95% of the people are using these coupons and opening accounts.  There is no major loss of employment.  There was some for some time but once the system corrects itself and the economy picks up, there would be more opportunities.  The agriculture sector is not affected negatively.  Manmohan Singh has held every economic position in this country.  He has been RBI governor, finance minister and our prime minister.  Wasn t it his responsibility to curb black money? I am sorry to say Manmohan Singh is a failed economist, a failed finance minister and a failed prime minister.  It is because of his government and his party s monumental mismanagement that we have the problem of black money.  He seems to have spoken out of vengeance.  We are in this mess because of them. She is aiming for something big, something higher.  She is thinking that she can be the main alternative. It is not a sudden move.  This was always on the Prime Minister s agenda.  The first item on our first Cabinet meeting on May 27, 2014, was the formation of SIT under Justice M B Shah.  All our steps over the years have been towards checking black money.  We have signed international agreements. Yes, definitely.  You cannot say that with this move alone the entire black money will go.  It is not only in cash but also in kind.  The ultimate aim is to move towards digital transfers

 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday strongly defended demonetisation ofandover Parliament logjam, saying unlike earlier when opposition parties stalled the House against scams, Congress-led parties are now doing so against government's steps to curb black money and corruption. "We needed to do it in 1971.  We have caused huge losses by not doing this since 1971," Modi told BJP MPs, lashing out at the Congress for not taking effective measures to curb black money in the country. The Prime Minister referred to former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole's book in which he has recorded how then Home Minister YB Chavan had recommended demonetisation to curb ill-gotten and hidden wealth. "Godbole says in the book that Gandhi replied saying 'are no more elections to be fought by the Congress'? Chavan got the message and the recommendation was (dropped)," Modi said. "This was in 1971 when everybody recommended this.  Had it (demonetisation) been done in 1971, the nation wouldn't have been in this situation today. "The recording of the Prime Minister's speech was broadcast hours after he addressed the BJP parliamentary party. Modi's remarks at the BJP parliamentary party meeting came on the last day of the winter session, which has been adue to impasse over demonetisation. Targeting Congress, the Prime Minister alleged that it has always put its interest over that of the country while for the BJP the nation's interests is supreme. He againas he appealed to the masses to adopt it as a "way of life" to rid the society of corruption and black money. Attacking former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has been, Modi said he advocated strong measures against corruption and black money but did "nothing" during his rule of 10 years. He also cited late Left stalwart Harkishan Singh Surjeet to support his government's action. "Earlier the ruling side, especially Congress, would commit scams like 2G, coal-gate, Bofors and the opposition would then unite and fight against it on the principle of honesty. "But now the ruling side, the BJP-led NDA, has started a campaign again black money and corruption and opposition parties are standing against it," he said. Modi also noted that the Wanchoo Committee in early 70s had recommended demonetisation when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister, recalling that the then senior Left leader Jyotirmoy Basu had demanded its quick implementation, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters following the meeting. "The Wanchoo committee had said it will boost economy.  Now after 45 years we have done demonetisation but Congress is opposing it.  The Left has also joined hands with Congress," he said. Painting Congress as a "votary of corruption", he said it had made a law against benami assets in 1988 but never notified it or framed rules and regulations, ensuring that the legislation never came into force. "For us, the country's interests are always above the party's.  For Congress, party's interests are above the country's," the PM said. On a day that marks the, Modi also targeted the opposition over its remarks on the Army's surgical strikes.

At Kanpur rally, PM Modi highlights government's bonanza for digital payments  -----  Dec 19, 2016, 11. 31 PM   -----  KANPUR: At an impressive rally in the city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged people to go cashless and elaborated in detail the government sops for going digital. 15,000 lucky winners would be announced every day for 100 days as a "gift beginning December 25", the Prime Minster said. "The first draw would be held on December 25 as a Christmas gift," he said. The Prime Minister, without naming any party, also put the responsibility for logjam in Parliament solely on the Congress-led Opposition and more than once tried to blame the party for spreading "lies" on demonetisation. Welcoming the recommendation by the Election Commission of India (ECI), to bring down accountable donation amount from more than Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000, PM Modi said: "Neither a comma or a full stop had been touched by the Congress in the law regarding accounts of political parties made 35 years back. " Congress leaders, however, were trying to defame the BJP government, he added. Citing the functioning of former Congress party and its treasurer Late Sitaram Kesari, whom he called "permanent treasurer" and quoted Congress leaders as saying "Na khata na bahi, jo Sitaram Kesari kahein, wahi sahi". During all party meeting before the Parliament session began, PM Modi said that he had proposed that discussion should be held on donation by the political parties and that both Parliament and assembly elections should be held together. However, Parliament was not allowed to function as they didn't want to take part in discussion on the both the issues, the Prime Minister said. "Our agenda is end to corruption and black money, but they have agenda to stall Parliament.  For one month, Parliament has not been allowed to function despite President (Pranab Mukherjee) making a remark," the Prime Minister said. They were afraid because they had to give account of their past deeds hence paper missiles were thrown at the Speaker, Modi said.  "Even those who are elected in municipality think 50 times before indulging in such deeds," the Prime Minister said. Trying to reply to oppostion's talk of NDA not allowing the Parliament to function when it was in opposition, the Prime Minister said that Parliament had seen logjam earlier also, but then the opposition was trying to corner government over issues of corruption and wanted scamsters to be booked. But for the first time, some of them in a bid to help corrupt were raising slogans in Parliament, Modi said and added that the government was trying to take to task the corrupt, while Opposition was uniting to protect corrupts and dishonests. The country is divided into two parts, he said and added that on one hand, there are handful of leaders who want to protect corrupt, while on the other hand, the whole country is ready to bear any pain to tread the path of honesty. It is black money and black heart that has committed atrocities on poor and middle income group, Modi said and added people cannot expect much from those who are in the habit of dishonesty and corruption. Hitting out at the present Akhilesh government without naming it, the Prime Minister said for the past some days whenever he has visited the state he has seen that storm of change and not the winds of change blowing in the state. People are fed up with "goondagardi", Modi said and added that those sitting in government are giving shelter to those involved in rowdism and land grabbing. Until people change the government in the state, they would not get rid of goonda elements, Modi exhorted. Earlier, giving details of government's scheme to promote cashless transaction, the Prime Minister, in what might be projected by the BJP as a reply to party's pre-poll promise to give Rs 15 lakh from the black money in bank account of each citizen, said: "a total of 15 lakh houses would get Rs 1,000 each until 100 days get over". However, only low income people would get the benefit of this scheme, he added.  Those who spend more than Rs 50 and less than Rs 3,000 through e-wallet, debit, credit cards of other e-transaction means, would only be eligible for the scheme, said the Prime Minister, laying thrust on bonanza primarly for poor and low income people. Those who spend more than Rs 3,000 through e-transaction don't need gift, Modi added amidst cheer from the crowd at the Railway ground in the Kanpur city. On December 30, there would be another draw when lakhs would be given in prize money, he said and added thereafter, on April 14 when Dr BR Ambedkar birth anniversary would celebrated, bumper draw would be held through which crores would be given as prize. He said that similar schemes would be for small shopkeepers and businessmen who have yearly turnover of less than Rs 2 crore. Earlier, hitting out at Congress-led Opposition, he said that while one hand they say that poor people in India don't have bank account and on the other hand they say that poor people are suffering by standing in long queues. Similarly, they had made huge claims that then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had brought computers and mobile phones in the country and when he talks about mobile banking, they only say that poor people don't have mobile phone.  "Why lying so much," he said and added that people should understand what type of Opposition they are.

NDA govt: Modi govt's 3rd anniversary: Zero tolerance on corruption  -----  May 18, 2017, 09. 01 AM   -----  This is a government that has zero tolerance on corruption, which doesn t hesitate to mount a surgical strike on Pakistan and also one that is pro-poor in its approach, with a focus on the  gaon, garib aur kisaan  (village, poor and the farmer)   this is expected to be the message in the Narendra Modi government s three-year anniversary document, to be unveiled next week. There is not a single taint of corruption on this government   totally different from the UPA tenure riddled with scams.  This will be the dominant message , a senior government official privy to the details said, speaking to ET on the condition of anonymity. The document will detail the steps the government has taken to tackle corruption, officials with knowledge of the matter said.  The most prominent among these is demonetisation , which has  strengthened the hands of the common citizen and the government in the fight against corruption, terror funding, Naxalism, human trafficking, black money and counterfeit notes , one of them said. Direct benefit transfer   where the subsidy amount is transferred directly to the beneficiary s bank account   has plugged leakages in welfare programmes and helped the government save Rs  50,000 crore.  So, this would also be mentioned as a significant anti-corruption measure.  The government may also say that it started the cleaning up of political funding by putting a Rs  2,000 cap on cash donations to parties. The fight against black money will find a prominent mention.  This will include blocking the Mauritius, Singapore and Cyprus channels used for re-routing of black money.  Another is the agreement on real-time transaction data with Switzerland, which will make Swiss banks to share information related to transactions involving Indians from September 2019.  This is expected to reduce the room for money laundering. The Mauritius route accounted for 35% of black money laundered and a bilateral treaty signed with that country last May will reduce the scope for this, the government is likely to say.  The Third Protocol signed with Singapore, which will give India the right from April 1, 2017, to tax capital gains arising on Indian equity shares sold by a Singapore resident, may also be cited as a measure that will check the menace of black money and prevent double non-taxation.  The government may highlight steps it has taken to investigate cases involving black money stashed abroad and initiate prosecution against those involved. The document is expected to highlight the benaami transaction law, implemented by the Modi government, as a key measure to block holding of black money in the form of real estate.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will also be described as an anti-corruption measure and one of the biggest economic reforms next to goods and services tax. Another measure to find a mention is the allocation of 82 coal blocks through a transparent auction that has generated an income of Rs  5 lakh crore, as well as spectrum auctions.  Also featuring among the government s achievement could be  Project Insight , an IT project conceived by the income tax department to effectively utilise vast information at its disposal to track tax evaders more effectively.

Bharat bandh: Day ahead of nation-wide protests, PM Narendra Modi, opposition spar over demonetisation  -----  Nov 27, 2016, 10. 47 PM   -----  demonetisation +

 demonetising old high-denomination currency notes +
 
 Nitish Kumar has supported demonetisation +

 NEW DELHI/ KUSHI NAGAR/ PATNA: A day ahead of the nation-wide protests planned by the opposition againstdefended the move and warned unscrupulous people using the Jan Dhan accounts of the poor to launder their black money of strict action. Lead opposition party Congress continued to target Modi over, terming it a "political move made without preparation" that stemmed from his propensity for "dhamaka politics" (politics aimed at seeking publicity). The JD(U) will, however, not be a part of the proposed protests as its leader and Bihar Chief Ministerof old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. Withaccounts witnessing a surge in deposits, Modi issued a warning to those using poor people to park their illegal money, saying the strict 'benami' law would be implemented against such transactions. He appealed to the people to shift to cashless system of transactions like mobile banking and asked the youth to help in this process by educating the elders and those not literate. In his monthly radio programme 'Mann ki Baat', first after the demonetisation decision, Modi devoted substantial part of the 37-minute broadcast to the issue over which he is under opposition attack. The Prime Minister said, "Even now, some people think they can bring their black money, the money earned through corruption or the one which is unaccounted for, back into the system through illegal means. "Unfortunately, they are misusing the poor for this purpose by misleading, luring or tempting them by putting money into their accounts. "He said "a very stringent law to deal with 'benami' transactions is being implemented, that will make such things (transactions) very difficult.  Government does not want the people to face such difficulties. ""I would tell such (unscrupulous) people that to reform or not reform is your wish.  Following the law or not is your wish - that the law will take care of.  But please don't play with the life of the poor.  Don't do anything due to which, when there is an investigation, the name of the poor comes on record and he gets into trouble because of you. "Later, addressing BJP's 'Parivartan Yatra' in UP's Kushinagar, Modi repeatedly attacked his rivals for calling a 'Bharat Bandh' on Monday. "We are trying to check black money and they are busy calling a Bharat Bandh.  Tell me, what should be stopped? Should black money be stopped or a Bharat Bandh be called?"Speaking to reporters in Delhi, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh , however, said no 'Bharat Bandh' has been called and that opposition parties will only hold protests across the country against demonetisation. Calling demonetisation a political move, Ramesh said it had brought all economic activity to a standstill. "It is a political decision for three reasons.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes in 'dhamaka' (publicity oriented) approach to politics.  This is a dhamaka which has changed the narrative.  From November 8 there is no other talk but of demonetisation," he said. Ramesh said demonetisation decision was also taken as Modi had seen the writing on the wall in UP, which is due for elections next year and wanted to do something dramatic.  The third reason was to cover up his failure to bring back illegal money stashed abroad, he said. "Does the Prime Minister want to have cash-less mandi? Does the PM want to have the unorganized sector working cashless? I am sorry to say it's a ridiculous proposition, to say that India will become cashless and all these economic sectors will become cash-less," he said. The ruling Samajwadi Party in poll-bound UP said the demonetisation drive smacked of an attempt at "financially harming" rival political parties ahead of elections. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move is aimed at financial harming rival political parties in 2017 UP Assembly polls.  This poll is a do or die for BJP.  BJP thought that due to impact of demonetisation, rival parties in the state will not be able to withdraw money for polls," SP national vice president Kironmay Nanda said. "BJP does not know that this step is going to be 'atmghati' (suicidal) for the party.  People who are standing in long queues for getting their own money will vote against BJP to vent their ire," he said. AIADMK attacked Modi for speaking about demonetisation only outside Parliament, saying he was "slighting Constitution and democracy". Listing a set of questions over demonetisation and its implications, AIADMK said, "The Prime Minister who is supposed to answer all these questions is slighting the Constitution and democracy by seeking to explain about it only in places other than the Parliament". ". . Having many loopholes (in demonetisation), the BJP's claim to root out black money is like cultivation of desert by drawing water using a bucket that has a sieve for its bottom," the Tamil Nadu's ruling party said in its mouthpiece, 'Dr Namadhu MGR'. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , who has been at the forefront of the agitation against demonetisation, attacked Modi for his advice to people to shift to cashless transactions. "Modiji, you have finished India's economy and growth.  We don't trust you or your mismatched wrong technology which you are advertising for.  We want technology and progress.  But no section of society is to be left out and tortured while doing this (demonetisation)," Banerjee said in a statement. "The women of our country will give you a befitting reply.  They are the mothers of India.  They are the mothers of all, Mr Today's PM," the Trinamool Congress chief said. Claiming that the masses were with the government on demonetisation, BJP voiced confidence that the protest called by certain opposition parties tomorrow will not be successful and said parties like Congress were already retreating and not calling it a 'Bharat bandh'. "It is quite evident that the country is united and is with us on demonetisation.  There are only a few parties which have supported the call for 'Bharat bandh'.  Those who were raising their voices earlier are also stepping back in fear now," Union minister Babul Supriyo told reporters at the BJP headquarters. Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu took a jibe at the Congress for planning to stage protests on . "Congress is clearly rattled by certain transformational results. . . this is the clear reason for it being angry," he said. "Realising the popular support to demonetisation, it is now calling its countrywide bandh 'akrosh' rallies.  From this, it is clear that all of this is aimed at finding some space in the media as it has clearly lost its space at the debating forum of Parliament and in the minds of the people," Naidu said.

Rahul Gandhi: Rahul Gandhi making baseless charges against Modi out of frustration: BJP  -----  Dec 26, 2016, 07. 39 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi BJP on Monday said he was making untrue and baseless allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi due to his frustration over the "success" of the campaign against black money and corruption. It said the Congress vice-president was afraid that the government's ongoing action against corruption will result in expose of a number of graft cases involving his party leaders. "Rahul Gandhi is frustrated and desperate due to success of Modi's campaign against black money and corruption.  He is perhaps most hurt by demonetisation, thus levelling untrue and baseless allegations.  That is why he raked up charges which the Supreme Court had refused to take note of. "He talks about the government not disclosing the names of people having unauthorised accounts in foreign banks.  We have handed over the list to the SIT.  Disclosing names will only help the suspects as our government then will not get help from these countries.  This is what he wants," BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma said. He noted that former Union minister Preneet Kaur 's names had cropped up in one such list of foreign account holders.  She has maintained that she never had such an account. Gandhi is himself out on bail in the National Herald case of corruption, he said, claiming that industry groups run by Adani brothers and Anil Ambani had run up debt of Rs 72 thousand crore and Rs 1. 13 lakh crore respectively during the UPA government. "UPA government had waived off debts running into over Rs 36 lakh crore to corporate groups.  Out government is working to recover their debts," he said, responding to the charge that the Modi government was "pro-rich and pro-corporate". Addressing a public rally in Baran in Rajasthan, Gandhi alleged that the note ban decision "is not against corruption but is an economic lockdown.  It is not against black money but against the poor, farmers, labourers and women". "In the last two-and-a-half years, Modi only worked to create a divide in the country and functioned only for the rich," he alleged.

 NEW DELHI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Urjit Patel on Friday said that the cash crisis following the recent demonetisation in the country will normalize "soon", ANI reported. "All efforts are being made to normalise situation in rural areas," Patel said while explaining the demonetisation and its impact to the Public Accounts Committee. He also said that specific agencies like Financial Intelligence Unit and Income Tax Department are looking into abnormal deposits. "The organisation is also working on bringing down transaction costs of digital payments," Patel informed committee. Earlier this week, Patel had told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance that new currency notes worth Rs 9. 2 lakh crore have been introduced into the system post the removal of old notes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in a surprise move on November 8, demonetised high-value currency notes in order to curb the menace of black money, sucking out 86 per cent of cash currency in circulation in the country.  The total value of the demonetised Rs1000 and Rs 500 notes was at Rs 14. 6 lakh crore.

   Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 8, 2016
 
 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today likened demonetisation to a Hindu 'yagna' or sacrifice. In a series of tweets, the PM again defended his decision to scrap high value currency, but this time focussed on its benefit for rural India and wage labourers, the people who have been the most affected by the cash crunch . The PM also made a mention of "a degree of inconvenience" due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and said that it was something he had alerted the country to and that "this short term pain will pave way for long term gains. ""I salute the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in this ongoing Yagna against corruption, terrorism & black money," he said. His focus though was on what he called "the backbone of the nation" that is farmers, traders and labourers. "The Government's decision has several gains for farmers, traders, labourers, who are the economic backbone of our nation.  No longer will the progress and prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption and black money.  Our villages must get their due," Modi said. The PM also called demonetisation "a historic opportunity" to move to a cashless, technologically-advanced India. "My young friends, you are agents of change who will make India corruption free and ensure more cashless transactions.  Together, we must ensure India defeats black money.  This will empower the poor, neo-middle class, middle class & benefit future generations,"he said. Earlier in the day, opposition leaders observed a 'Black Day' in Parliament premises to mark one month of the announcement of demonetisation, with Rahul Gandhi launching a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying his "foolish decision" has "devastated" the country.

Use digital cash to serve nation, build 'New India': PM on Mann ki Baat  -----  Mar 26, 2017, 04. 04 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: In his 30th edition of 'Mann ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi again pushed his 'New India' slogan saying that demonetisation has been "a big step" towards a new and better nation. His address had numerous references to 'New India', making it apparent he wanted to popularize the slogan in the country much in the manner of his 'Make in India' one. "Use digital money to serve India," Modi said, talking about his government's move to ban high-value notes, a move that has been, and continues to be criticized by many. "New India is not a government scheme or a matter of politics," he said, even as he defended his government's demonetisation move and claimed it has already led to a huge reduction in corruption and black money.  And that, of course, is a big step towards Modi's idea of a 'New India'. The PM also claimed - again contrary to what critics say - that the country has embraced demonetization and a future with increased digital transactions. "India has extended support to movement towards digital transactions.  People have rejected corruption and black money," the PM said, adding that evidence of that is the "popularity" of the government's Bhim app that enables digital transactions for the common man and woman who may not have a smartphone. "In the last few months, particularly after demonetization, there has been an increase in digital payments.  It has been 2-2. 5 months since the Bhim app was launched and over 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it," he said, without giving details of how many of those who downloaded it are actively using it. In addition to moving to digital transactions, keeping one's environs clean and being healthy, both physically and mentally, will all contribute to a new and better country, Modi said. Earlier in his address, Modi congratulated Bangladesh on its Independence Day.  He also paid rich tributes to Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, freedom fighters and martyrs.

demonetisation: Congress demands judicial probe into 'demonetisation conspiracy'  -----  Jan 7, 2017, 07. 33 PM   -----  MUMBAI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday demanded a judicial probe into the " demonetisation scam", claiming that most of the black money had returned to the banks which suggested a "conspiracy". Sibal claimed at a press conference here that of the Rs 15. 15 lakh crore in old currency that was demonetised, Rs 14. 97 lakh crore was back in the banking system. "Is the alleged black money becoming legitimate? This cannot happen without conspiracy of the ruling BJP and banking institutions," Sibal alleged. "If the money which is deposited in the banks is not black money, what is the fight to curb black money, which (Prime Minister) Modi talks about to justify demonetisation, for? We demand a probe by a judicial commission in the demonetisation scam," he said. Narendra Modi had asked the people to bear the pain for 50 days after demonetisation and said he was ready to face any punishment after that, Sibal pointed out, adding now the PM should announce what punishment he would take and where, as the situation was not yet normal. "RBI Governor Urjit Patel and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley are unaware of how much money has come back in the banking system," the Congress spokesperson said, alleging that demonetisation was a "conspiracy to benefit BJP". Sibal also slammed the NDA government for advancing the Budget with an eye on Assembly elections.  "Why was the need for preponing the Budget when the allocations will be implemented from April 1," he asked. As per a Right to Information reply to a question by Congress, only eight government nominees on the central board of RBI attended the meeting on November 8 (prior to demonetisation), he claimed. "Why was the 21-member board with independent directors not called? Was demonetisation a government or RBI decision?" he said. Why BJP took no action against its own office-bearers in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu who were allegedly caught with "bundles of new Rs 2,000 notes", Sibal asked. Congress would seek reply from PM in the budget session, he said.  "He (Modi) did not speak in the Monsoon session.  We want him to reply to our charges in the Parliament and not outside," Sibal said.

PM Modi to address the nation at 7. 30pm  -----  Dec 31, 2016, 07. 33 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 7. 30pm on Saturday as the 50-day period sought by him to ease the cash crunch situation across the country got over on Friday. According to reports, PM Modi is likely to speak on the road map ahead after his demonetisation decision. Prime Minister has strongly defended his demonetisation move and has said it will help in the fight against corruption and black money. On Thursday, speaking at the DigiDhan Mela, PM had said how demonetisation has changed the narrative from 'how much cash was lost in scams' to 'how much cash has come back in the system". He has dropped enough indications that demonetisation will not be an isolated move, but the beginning of government's fight against corruption. PM Modi had last addressed the nation on November 8 to announce demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to root out corruption and black money from the country. After demonetisation, PM Modi had said: "Help me for 50 days and I will give you the India you desired. "A day before the PM's address, the RBI had announced increase in daily ATM withdrawal limits from the present Rs 2,500 to Rs 4,500. Opposition parties have attacked the Centre over the implementation of the move, with a few choosing to oppose it altogether.

Akhilesh Yadav: Akhilesh Yadav gives compensation over demonetisation deaths  -----  Dec 24, 2016, 08. 13 PM   -----  cashless economy as a "bigger dream +
 
 note ban +

 LUCKNOW: Taking a dig at Narendra Modi 's demonetisation move, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav termed" than 'achche din' and said the note ban will be an issue in the upcoming assembly elections in the state. "The dream of cashless economy is a bigger one than achche din. . .  it is however for the government to see how it will be realised," he said at a function to distribute cheques to the families of martyrs and 14 persons who allegedly lost their lives while standing in queues outside ATMs/banks after demonetisation. Attacking the BJP government on, Yadav, without taking names, alleged that people have been betrayed and economy harmed. "Earlier (when the note ban was announced) people had faith, or rather confusion, that a big change will be brought. . .  but soon after the very same people started saying that there could not have been a bigger loss to the economy. . .  national and international economists are also writing about it. "It is for the government to see how it will work out the losses to the GDP but it is a fact the people had to face hardships and I have said earlier too that the government which pose problems are voted out by people," he said, adding that in the coming elections those who had faced problems will stand against them. Uttar Pradesh is the first state in the country to announce compensation for the families of those who allegedlyoutside banks and ATMs for long post demonetisation. Chief minister had earlier this month announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the families of 'demonetisation victims' Giving examples of major risk in online transactions, Yadav said one of the accused arrested for fraudulently withdrawing money from someone's account said that he was caught because he was a "novice". "Anyone who becomes an expert in cyber crime will never be arrested," the chief minister said after presenting cheques of Rs two lakh each to the families of 14 people who allegedly died while standing in bank queues. To a question on what will be the election issue, Yadav said "Development, road, water all will be elections issues. . .  why would note ban not be an election issue". Taking a dig at the BJP, Yadav said he has come to know that the 'parivartan rath yatra' was attacked by those standing in bank queue in Deoria recently. . .  They need to remain alert while taking out the rath yatra and avoid banks on the route. "When asked about alliance, Yadav said party president Mulayam Singh Yadav will decide on alliance. "I have already said that SP is going to form a government and if we go into the polls in an alliance we will win more than 300 seats," he said. Claiming that the next SP government will take forward the works undertaken by the present regime, Yadav said the state needs to be taken on a new direction towards development and prosperity. Over Centre's schemes, Yadav said UP government was extending full support to central schemes saying that AIIMS was coming up in Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur only because the state provided land for it. "But if there is any scheme which farmers do not like or feel that they will not benefit from it what can UP government do. .  it is for them to explain the benefits of their scheme to farmers and take their schemes to poor. . .  take Jan Dhan Yojna, first it was stated that it is for the poor and when money was deposited it was termed as black money," he said. Yadav reiterated that UP has had to suffer loss worth Rs 9,000 crore after Niti Ayog came into being.

For first time since November 8, a rise in notes in circulation  -----  Jan 19, 2017, 06. 09 AM   -----  MUMBAI: Currency in circulation which had been consistently declining since demonetisation rose for the first time in the week ended January 13, according to data released by Reserve Bank of India.  Numbers published by RBI on Wednesday show that currency in circulation, which reflect the total value of legal tender in the form of currency notes, stood at Rs 9. 5 lakh crore as on January 13, up Rs 52,790 crore during the week. Total currency in circulation as on November 8 stood at Rs 17. 97 lakh crore and Rs 15. 44 lakh crore of high denomination notes were demonetised.  This means that the addition of new currency to replace the scrapped notes was Rs 6. 97 lakh crore up to January 13. Interestingly , reports state that governor Urjit Patel has informed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance that RBI has infused Rs 9. 2 lakh crore of new currency notes into the system after demonetisation. According to a report by Nomura adjusting for holidays, the average daily value of new notes printed has fallen from Rs 14,000 crore during the first six weeks (10 Nov-19 Dec) to Rs3,700 crore between 19 Dec and 13 Jan. "This is probably because the RBI's focus has shifted to printing the lower-denomination notes (Rs 500 note and lower) from higher denomination notes (Rs 2000 note) earlier.  Hence, the process of remonetisation is progressing, but incrementally at a slower pace," the report said.  According to Nomura, the economy no longer requires a cash-to-GDP ratio of 12% since part of the cash was hoarded and because of a larger digital footprint.

Demonetisation is a disaster, says Digvijaya Singh  -----  Dec 27, 2016, 12. 34 PM   -----  Demonetisation is a disaster Modi ji whether you believe it or not.  You have pushed Indian Economy back without achieving your objectives.

 NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday said although the Narendra Modi government's move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was aimed at keeping a check on black money, it has been a "disaster". He alleged that the move has hit farmers as vegetable prices crashed down after demonetisation. "Demonetisation is a disaster Modi ji whether you believe it or not.  You have pushed Indian Economy back without achieving your objectives," Singh said in a tweet. On November 10, the Congress general secretary had claimed that the demonetisation decision was "arbitrarily" taken by the PM Modi and not by the Union Cabinet. "It is a decision to curb black money.  Any decision to curb black money is welcome.  But black money is with the big people, who don't keep cash.  They have got investment in properties, jewellery, abroad in tax havens.  No big corporate house keeps cash," Singh had said. He alleged that the move has put daily wage earners, rather than the "big people", in difficult situation.

corruption allegation against PM Modi: PM Narendra Modi using note ban to repay loans of '50 super-rich families', says Rahul Gandhi  -----  Dec 18, 2016, 03. 39 AM   -----  BELAGAVI: Continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi dubbed demonetisation on Saturday a "Modi- made disaster".  He alleged that Modi undertook the exercise to repay the loans of "50 super rich families" who "marketed" him for the Prime Minister's post. Addressing Congress workers here, Rahul questioned Modi's claim that demonetisation would flush out black money .  "Where is the black money? It's with the super rich families, not with poor farmers, labourers or middle-class families.  But you will not find this money with them if you go to their houses," he said. Without specifying who the "super rich" were, Rahul added: "Thieves of this country are very intelligent and they would have invested in gold, real estate, buildings and other assets.  Only 6% of the black money is in cash, while 94% has been invested.  This has been admitted by the PM himself.  Even then, why is he running behind the people with 6% of the black money, sparing those who invested 94%, and troubling 99%?'' he said. He alleged the "50 super-rich families" used their black money to market Modi for the PM's post.  "These people have taken around Rs 8 lakh crore in loan from banks.  The PM who got a favour from these families cannot dare to recover the Rs 8 lakh crore from them and hence came up with the demonetisation plan," he said. "Modi made every poor and middle-class family deposit their money in the bank so that the institutions can run smoothly.  With your money he is now running all the banks,'' Rahul said.  He alleged that Modi had leaked information about the demonetisation plan to his friends in BJP.

Narendra Modi: PM Modi asks BJP MPs, MLAs to submit bank transaction details between Nov 8 and Dec 31 to Amit Shah  -----  Nov 29, 2016, 02. 26 PM   -----  depositing demonetised notes +

 Winter session of the Parliament +
 
 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked BJP MPs and MLAs to submit details of their bank account transactions between November 8 and December 31 to party President Amit ShahNovember 8 was when PM Modi announced that the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes would be scrapped at midnight, and December 31 comes a day after the deadline forin bank accounts. The PM's instructions came at a BJP Parliamentary meeting, followingthat the BJP had tipped off some of its own leaders ahead of the demonetisation announcement. Demonetisation has been hailed by many as a body, but also criticized as a pre-election stunt, ahead of key polls in several states next year. It's being discussed in the, and yesterday, the Opposition stalled proceedings for the eighth consecutive day.  Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned prematurely. A number of Opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Congress), Sudip Bandhopadhyay (Trinamool Congress) and Mulayam Singh Yadav (Samajwadi Party), asked that their demand for an Adjournment Motion - and for a debate under a rule that entails voting - be accepted.  They also demanded the presence of the Prime Minister during the debate. In response, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the Prime Minister will speak on demonetisation, but that a debate - for which the rules will be decided by the Speaker - should take place. PM Modi today also rejected allegations that the Income Tax Amendment Bill tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday was aimed at converting black money into white. "The PM described the move as a fight against black money and said it is for the welfare of poor," Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters. He added that the PM had also sought support from everyone to make India a digital and cashless economy.

Threat hovering over democracy, says Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati  -----  Dec 29, 2016, 09. 01 PM   -----  RAIPUR: Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati on Thursday said, clouds of threat was hovering over democracy as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is repeatedly trying to "browbeat" the people with his statements that his government would not spare the dishonest. "Government's job is to protect the people and save them from any crisis.  But the Prime Minister is threatening the masses," the seer of Jyotish and Dwarka Sharada Peeth said in a strongly worded statement on completion of 50 days of demonetization Pointing out money power always plays an important role in all elections right from gram panchayats to parliament, the Shankaracharya said while announcing demonetization, Prime Minister Modi had stated that the notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 would cease to be legal tender but now an ordinance has been promulgated making a provision to jail those who are in possession of 10 pieces of junked currency notes.  "Why one should be jailed for keeping just a few pieces of paper?" He wondered. The Shankaracharya said the manner in which the government is trying to change the narrative by propagating for a cashless society indicates that an individual's economic freedom is also under threat.  "Do we have a proper system for data protection to prevent hacking and other issues associated with digital economy?" He asked adding that the crisis triggered after demonetization had badly affected all sections of the society, including farmers, small and medium businessmen. Shankaracharya said that after having failed to handle the situation arising out of demonetization, Modi government is now trying to divert peoples'attention with yet another propaganda to acquire and confiscate benami property.  He asked how the government would go about in implementing it, pointing out that such an action would directly hit the farmers and their land as many of them have divided their property into different names because of ceiling laws. "A government is voted to power for a period of five years during which it has to make efforts to fulfil its election promises," the Shankaracharya said adding that "when a ruling party compares opposition to an enemy like Pakistan, it's an indication that it cannot tolerate an opposition.  Ruling party's such an intolerance is now becoming a matter of serious concern," the seer said.

 NEW DELHI: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today thattheir bank transaction details since the currency ban said the PM should ask for their transaction details of the last six months. Earlier today, in a bid to stem allegations that party members were aware he was going to scrap high-denomination notes on November 8, the PM asked BJP MPs and MLAs to submit details of their bank account transactions between November 8 and December 31, to party president Amit Shah , by January 1. In fact, it was this precise allegation that the Aam Aadmi Party chief again levelled.  He tweeted that the BJP lawmakers would have already "taken care of their money" before November 8. Days after Modi announced the currency ban, Kejriwal alleged thatby the government and that the BJP and other players were aware it was going to happen. "A huge scam has been perpetrated a few days ago in the name of tackling corruption.  When the PM announced the move, he had informed all of his friends who had black money and they secured their money," the Delhi CM added. Yesterday, finance minister Arun Jaitley moved a bill to change the Income Tax Act to include a penalty provision for unaccounted for deposits. Those who made and disclosed bank deposits of such unaccounted money - since the currency ban on November 8 - will have to forego 50% of the amount, a part of which will go into a special fund being created for welfare measures for the poor.  In addition, the depositor will be able to access only 25% of the amount as the government has decided to keep the rest locked in for four years as interest-free deposits for the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. However, right after the currency ban was announced, the government had warned that cash deposits above Rs 2. 5 lakh threshold under the 50-day window could attract tax plus a 200% penalty in case of an income mismatch. Kejriwal had something to say about that too, today. "First the government said it will impose a 200% penalty.  After 20 days, it's saying it will impose a 10% penalty.  Have those with black money made the OM bend to their will and reduce the penalty?" he tweeted. It's unclear where Kejriwal got the 10% penalty information from. Then he tweeted again to say: "So far Rs 8 lakh crore has been deposited in the bank.  Not one paisa of that is black money.  Currency ban is a fail.  "On November 12, the Delhi CM also alleged that there had been significant misreporting on deposits made at banks in months prior to November 8. "In previous quarters, deposits in banks were negative.  But in the July-to-September quarter, such large amounts were being deposited in the banks.  Who did all this money belong to?" Kejriwal asked. At the time, too, he mentioned the Adanis and Ambanis. "What kind of person holds black money in this country? Is it the Adanis, Ambanis, Subhash Chandras and Badals? Or is it rickshawala, cobbler, labourer or farmer?" Kejriwal asked.

PM Narendra Modi slams Congress, BSP and SP in Uttar Pradesh rally  -----  Jan 2, 2017, 06. 06 PM   -----  massive election campaign in Uttar Pradesh +
 
 Samajwadi Party +
 
 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP couldn't have chosen a more opportune time than today to kick off their.  And the PM made full use of it by getting in digs at the entire opposition to say that growth and development have stalled in the state because the BJP has been out of power there for 14 years. In one fell swoop, Modi dismissed the ruling(SP), which split yesterday politically and familially, the BSP , which has been beset with allegations of black money laundering and the Congress which has been having trouble regaining its lost glory in Uttar Pradesh. "There is one party with minimal presence in UP, that is trying for 15 years to establish their leader but with little success.  There is another party trying to save money and there is one more party trying to save their own family," the PM said at what the BJP has dubbed the 'Parivartan Rally' or the rally for change. The first party he referred to was the Congress, which has seen its political fortunes wane compared to its glory days in Uttar Pradesh in the 1970s and the 1980s. The second party he referred to was Mayawati's BSP which has not been able to shake off the taint of corruption allegations.  The third party he was referring to was the Samajwadi Party, which split yesterday following months of bickering between father Mulayam Singh Yadav and his chief minister son Akhilesh. The PM also said that even though the BJP has not been in power in Uttar Pradesh, that doesn't bother him and his party. "We don't look at politics through that lens.  Our not being in power for 14 years has meant no growth and development in UP for 14 years and that's what hurts the most," Modi said. India, he said, can't prosper and grow unless Uttar Pradesh prospers and grows. "When have you seen the SP and the BSP talking in one voice? It's rare to happen, but on my decision to end corruption they are (suddenly) speaking in one voice," Modi said about both those parties being critical of his move to scrap high-value currency notes as of November 8. "They say remove Modi I say remove black money, they say remove Modi, I say remove corruption.  You decide what you want to remove," he said, again extolling the virtues of a digital and cashless economy. The PM also predicted a win for the BJP in the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. "All the political pundits who keep track of election results. . after this rally they won't have to do any work to figure out who the winner will be.  They can just see all you people gathered here and get their answer.  The winds of change are visible," the PM said.

Waive off cash withdrawal limit for rural housing beneficiaries: Naveen to Modi  -----  Dec 16, 2016, 10. 33 PM   -----  BHUBANESWAR: Despite his initial support to the November 8 demonetization move , chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday wrote another letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that highlighted the inconvenience faced by people due to the decision. Naveen, in his fourth letter since the note ban move, urged Modi to waive out the financial limit of withdrawal from bank accounts for the beneficiaries of different rural housing schemes. The chief minister said that the total sanctioned amount for one unit of house is released in four installments -- Rs 20,000, Rs 30,000/35,000, Rs 40,000/45,000 and Rs 30,000. "Thus, the first installment of Rs 20,000 is within the limit of withdrawal from bank account set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) post demonetization, but the rest three others go beyond the stipulated limit of withdrawal," Naveen said adding the limit of withdrawal from bank account causes inconvenience to the poor beneficiaries of different housing schemes. The chief minister also said that the restriction on withdrawal has also been a dampener to the state government's goal of completing nearly 5 lakh houses during the current financial year (2016-17). So far, Odisha has succeeded in completing nearly 1. 4 lakh houses under different rural housing schemes (both centrally sponsored and state funded) like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Gramin, Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana, Indira Awas Yojana and Nirman Sharmika Pucca Ghara Yojana.  All these schemes are being implemented by the state panchayati raj department. "Timely release of installments to the beneficiaries, among other initiatives taken up by state, plays a pivotal role in successful implementation of these schemes," Naveen said. In his previous three letters, the chief minister raised objection on RBI decision regarding withdrawal of deposit and exchange facilities of scrapped notes at district central cooperative banks (DCCB), highlighted plight of farmers due to poor cash flow to DCCBs and requested exemption of PAN cards for people in scheduled areas for transactions of more than Rs 50,000. The chief minister also discussed all the issues during his meeting with the Prime Minister in New Delhi on November 21. Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra said the chief minister should make his stand clear on the demonetization issue as he keeps on writing letter to the Prime Minister highlighting its impact despite extending his support to the move initially. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said if Naveen (Babu) has any issues, he could have raised them in a panel constituted by the NITI Aayog to promote cashless transactions.  He also expressed doubt over the state government's claim regarding completion of 1. 4 lakh houses.

 Modi further reiterated +
 
 NEW DELHI: Again today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi insinuated that those not in favour of the note ban are in favour of corruption and black money. And that's why, the PM said, the opposition parties - who oppose the ban on high value notes -of Parliament .  "So they can protect the corrupt and their black money," he alleged. "Our agenda is stop corruption.  The Opposition's agenda is to stall Parliament.  My government is intent on stopping the corrupt and the opposition wants to protect them,"today, as he again took to the pulpit to tout a "cashless digital India. "The PM slammed the opposition for its "constant shouting and sloganeering in Parliament", which he said hurt the dignity of the august institution. "They were having trouble explaining the inaction against black money during their reign.  So they were shouting, throwing paper at the Speaker and running away from discussion on black money," Modi said about the winter session of Parliament that ended last Friday. his promise that the difficulties faced by citizens due to the ban will start to abate 50 days from November 8 when the ban came into effect. "I'd said right at the beginning, and I will say it again.  Just for 50 days there will be difficulties, after that all problems will start winding down," the PM said. The PM said he understands the difficulties the people have had since the note ban and added that "people suffered willingly"so their country could have a bright and honest future. "What my countrymen have done, the difficulties they've borne (since demonetization) is unprecedented in the world, they did it for the promise of an honest India.  The strength they've shown is lesson to the world," the PM declared. In his speech, Modi also stumped for Lok Sabha and state assembly polls to be held simultaneously "to reduce corruption. " At the same time, he also talked about bringing more transparency in political parties' spending and accounts. Of course, he said the opposition is against these two things because "they want to protect the corrupt and black money. "

Chidambaram: Note ban has robbed daily workers of their livelihoods  -----  Jan 11, 2017, 01. 28 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Former finance minister P Chidambaram said the BJP government has done a great damage to India's economy which was built with hard work over last ten years of UPA. Speaking at the Congress convention against demonetisation, Jan Vedana Sammelan Chidambaram said people were not talking about various schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi since they were all forgotten by government itself but were ruing the prevalent social strife and joblessness. He said demonetisation was a foolhardy step as was the push for digital payments.  He said it was the right of a citizen to decide how he should pay for his purchases, citing high prevalence of cash economy in Europe and the US. The Congress convention adopted a 'condolence resolution' on deaths caused by note ban. Slamming the note ban, Chidambaram wondered how will the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes end black money, terror funding or counterfeiting.  He said counterfeits of new Rs 2000 notes have already been seized in Indore, Moradabad and Kanpur. He said the PM had promised to end corruption but the first Rs 2000 notes were seized in Kandla Port Trust and other places in Gujarat. According to Chidambaram, 15 crore people depend on daily work and 30 crore on daily income in india, and that livelihood has been taken away in 50 days of demonetisation. He said the farm prices have crashed and farmers are suffering. "One man takes the decision.  He says I am the Fuhrer, I am the leader," mocked Chidambaram.

Mahesh Sharma: Play cricket, don t spoil the pitch, says Mahesh Sharma on SP s family feud  -----  Jan 4, 2017, 05. 57 PM   -----  NOIDA: Union minister Mahesh Sharma on Wednesday slammed the ruling Samajwadi Party over family feud and said that 'this was infighting of thieves for share of stolen money. "Just an hour before the election commission announced the dates of UP election, Sharma held a press conference in Noida said that it is the family matter of Samajwadi Party.  "This is an infighting for share of stolen money.  I advise them to play cricket, but don't spoil the pitch," he said. SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav expelled on Friday Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and general secretary Ramgopal Yadav from the party for six years.  However, next day Akhilesh was not only inducted in the party fold and was also made national president of the SP. The Union Minister said that the Samajwadi Party had come to power, promising that the corruption of BSP leaders in previous government will be investigated and Mayawati will be jailed.  "Nothing happened since they came into power.  No one was jailed.  It was the CBI which took initiative and arrested the Noida Authority engineer Yadav Singh for his corrupt practices," Sharma said. Sharma denied that he will be the face of UP chief minister in the election.  "The party will decide the CM candidate on right time," he said.  On Demonetization, Sharma said that it was a well-planned programme of Prime Minister to curb black money. "The Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched Jan Dhan Yojna in which around 23 crore bank accounts were opened.  This was to ensure that most people get connected to the banking system before the demonetization comes into effect," he said. Sharma added that he travelled in different districts of Uttar Pradesh and found that most people in the bank queues supported the move. He inaugurated the works of 76 kilometer roads completed in Rs 27. 19 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna in Gautam Budh Nagar.  He said that the works of installing 2000 solar lights have also started in the district under the Atal Jyoti Power Scheme.

 NEW DELHI: Over Rs 3,185 crore of undisclosed income has been detected while Rs 86 crore worth new notes have been seized by the income tax department as part of its country-wide operations against black money hoarders post the demonetisation of two high value currencies by the government. Official sources said the taxman carried out a total of 677 search, survey and enquiry operations under the provisions of the Income Tax Act since the, even as the department has issued over 3,100 notices to various entities on charges of tax evasion and hawala-like dealings.

Opposition s strike call a flop show: BJP  -----  Nov 29, 2016, 08. 27 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: BJP said the bandh called by the opposition against demonetisation flopped, thanks to the people's belief in a "noble government initiative", which was pro-poor and against corruption. "People have rejected those who support black money and corruption and appreciated the efforts of PM Narendra Modi against black money and corruption.  The leaders behind the calls for 'Bharat bandh' and Jan Aakrosh Diwas' are tainted and have been rejected by people," BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said. He alleged that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi are involved in the National Herald case and were out on bail, whereas Saradha scam had tainted West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.  "Samajwadi Party is running its government in Uttar Pradesh with the support of land and mining mafias, while BSP chief Mayawati is accused of the National Rural Health Mission scam," Sharma alleged.  He said Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's party MLAs were accused of various crimes. "Any call given by such leaders was bound to flop.  BJP expresses its thanks to people for rejecting these parties," Sharma said.  BJP has chalked out a strategy to educate people about the benefits of scrapping high value currency, in line with Modi's mantra of moving towards increased cashless transactions.  It also plans to tout the move as "pro-poor and a war against corruption" in the ongoing 'Parivartan Yatra' launched from the four corners of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Party president Amit Shah and finance minister Arun Jaitely have been briefing party leaders, including Union ministers and office bearers, to reach out to the people and make them aware about cashless options of transactions.  During a recent Cabinet meeting, Jaitley gave a detailed presentation on demonetisation and he urged Union ministers to fan out across the country with the message that demonetisation would cleanse the system. Party president Amit Shah has been consistently talking about demonetisation at public platform and party events.  "Parties often come up with populist policies but rarely take measures to shape up a better society," Shah said while addressing office bearers here on Monday. The BJP spokesperson agreed that their political campaign in UP was based on demonetisation thanks to the public support the move has received in the most populous state.  "Party leaders have several points to share with the common man including relief granted to farmers and permission to use scrapped currency for various household things," Sharma said. The Parivartan Yatra in UP has traversed more than 7,000 km, covering 36 districts in the past 20 days.  Party leaders claim to have interacted with more than 32 lakh people during the yatra.

Rajnath Singh: Critics should show patience for 50-day period: Rajnath  -----  Dec 2, 2016, 05. 55 PM   -----  LUCKNOW: In a message to those criticising note ban , Union home minsiter Rajnath Singh on Friday said they should show patience for the 50-day period as the decision has been taken keeping national interest in mind and the situation will normalize after that. "Those criticizing note ban must exercise patience for at least the 50-day period as the step has been taken in national interest to fight black money and corruption," he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi while announcing the demonetization decision on November 8 had said there will be some inconvenience to people for the initial 50-day period after which the situation will ease out. Singh was talking to media persons here on the sidelines of a function where he laid foundation stone of several railway projects. The home minister said the source of money supply will dry up, choking funding for terrorists and Maoists. Besides, the demonetisation decision will bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, he said. Opposition parties have locked horns with the government over the issue of demonetisation of high-value currencies with Parliament witnessing a virtual washout since the Winter Session began on November 16. Singh, who represents Lucknow constituency in Lok Sabha, said there should be no politics over development projects in the Uttar Pradesh. Observing that metro services will soon begin in Lucknow, he said whatever work he was doing for development of Lucknow, was dedicated to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was also an MP from the state capital till 2009 before retiring from active politics. His remarks came a day after chief minister Akhilesh Yadav flagged-off the trial run of Lucknow Metro in the state capital.

demonetisation: Modi asks BJP MPs, MLAs to submit bank a/c details  -----  Nov 30, 2016, 04. 53 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: There was a surprise at the routine BJP weekly parliamentary party meet on Tuesday as PM Narendra Modi asked all BJP ministers, MPs and MLAs to provide details of their banking transactions between November 8, when he announced demonetisation , and December 31. With the window to deposit old currency in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes closing on December 30, PM's call is seen as intended to provide transparency about party MPs amid opposition allegations that the ruling party was tipped off about the move.  At the meeting, Modi rejected the criticism that the bill to amend the Income Tax Act and provide a 50% tax on disclosed wealth will help turn black money into white and said the provisions will channel money "looted from the poor" for their welfare. Modi asked BJP lawmakers to share their account details with party president Amit Shah.  Though there wasn't any official word about the follow up after the MPs and MLAs furnish account details, party sources said the information could be put in the public domain.  "It will not be an easy task for party MPs as they will have to be transparent and virtually explain their household spending," said a senior government functionary, assuring that the move is not a mere eyewash as suggested by opposition parties. Party MPs, however, said it was already the norm in the party to share financial details while seeking candidature and they will not mind parting with account details.  "PM's decision was welcomed by all as we have no problems in abiding by PM's suggestion," said a senior party MP .  According to parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar, Modi explained the demonetisation decision by saying, "I will not allow the country to be weighed down by wads of currency notes (black money). "MPs said Modi reiterated that demonetisation was war against black money as he doesn't want to see the country suffer due to corruption.  "PM once again sought help of the MPs in popularising cashless transaction, which will be an effective tool against corruption," an MP said. Even Shah told party MPs to motivate people in in their constituency to shift to cashless transactions.  In his stern message to the party MPs, Shah said the party is in power to solve people's problems and not enjoy its fruits.  He also suggested that the MPs should counter opposition's misinformation campaign against demonetisation.

Narendra Modi: Who knew? How PM Modi kept note ban a closely guarded secret  -----  Dec 9, 2016, 02. 53 PM   -----  his boldest reform +
 
 came as a bolt from the blue +
 
 will bring more money into the banking system +
 
 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi handpicked a trusted bureaucrat, little known outside India's financial circles, to spearhead a radical move to abolish 86 per cent of the country's cash overnight and take aim at the huge shadow economy. Hasmukh Adhia, the bureaucrat, and five others privy to the plan were sworn to utmost secrecy, say sources with knowledge of the matter.  They were supported by a young team of researchers working in two rooms at Modi's New Delhi residence, as he plottedsince coming to power in 2014. When announced, the abolition of high-value banknotes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 rupeesThe secrecy was aimed at outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge, by pouring cash into gold, property and other assets and hide illicit wealth. Previously unreported details of Modi's handling of the so-called " demonetisation " open a window onto the hands-on role he played in implementing a key policy, and how he was willing to act quickly even when the risks were high. While some advocates say the scrapping of the banknotesand raise tax revenues, many Indians are furious at having to queue for hours outside banks to exchange or deposit their old money. Moreover, not enough replacement notes were printed in preparation for the upheaval, and it could take months for things to return to normal. With Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, holding an election in early 2017 that could decide Modi's chances of a second term in office, there is little time for the hoped-for benefits of his cash swap to outweigh short-term pain. Modi has staked his reputation and popularity on the move. "I have done all the research and, if it fails, then I am to blame," Modi told a cabinet meeting on November 8 shortly before the move was announced, according to three ministers who attended. Overseeing the campaign, with support from the backroom team camped out at Modi's sprawling bungalow in the capital, was Adhia, a top finance ministry official. The 58-year-old served as principal secretary to Modi from 2003-06 when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, establishing a relationship of trust with his boss and introducing him to yoga. Colleagues interviewed by Reuters said he had a reputation for integrity and discretion. Adhia was named revenue secretary in September 2015, reporting formally to finance minister Arun Jaitley.  In reality, he had a direct line to Modi and they would speak in their native Gujarati when they met to discuss issues in depth. In the world's largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary: it called into question the state's promise to "pay the bearer" the face value on every banknote. At a stroke, Modi scrapped money worth 15. 4 trillion rupees ($220 billion), equal to 86 percent of cash in Asia's third-largest economy. The idea is backed by some economists, although the speed of its implementation is widely seen as radical. "One is never ready for this kind of disruption - but it is a constructive disruption," said Narendra Jadhav, a 31-year veteran and former chief economist of India's central bank who now represents BJP in the Rajya Sabha. Modi, in his TV address to the nation, cautioned that people could face temporary hardship as replacement 500 and 2,000 rupee notes were introduced.  Calling for an act of collective sacrifice, he promised steps to soften the blow for the nine in 10 Indians who live in the cash economy. Immediately after the address, Adhia sent a tweet: "This is the biggest and the boldest step by the government for containing black money. "The boast harked back to Modi's election vow to recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed up with the corruption scandals that plagued the last Congress government.  Yet in office, he struggled to keep his promise. Over more than a year, Modi commissioned research from officials at the finance ministry, the central bank and think-tanks on how to advance his fight against black money, a close aide said. He demanded answers to questions such as: How quickly India could print new banknotes; how to distribute them; would state banks benefit if they received a rush of new deposits; and who would gain from demonetisation?The topics were broken up to prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that a cash swap was in the offing. "We didn't want to let the cat out of the bag," said a senior official directly involved.  "Had people got a whiff of the decision, the whole exercise would have been meaningless. "Under Adhia's oversight, the team of researchers assembled and modeled the findings in what was, for it, a theoretical exercise. It was made up of young experts in data and financial analysis; some ran Modi's social media accounts and a smartphone app that he used to solicit public feedback. Yet for all the planning, Modi and Adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality, and were willing to move swiftly. The announcement caused chaos, with huge queues forming at banks when they reopened after a short holiday. New 2,000 rupee notes were hard to come by and barely any new 500 rupee notes had been printed.  India's 200,000 cash dispensers could not handle the new, smaller, notes and it would take weeks to reconfigure them. Filling ATMs with the 8 trillion rupees ($117 billion) in new banknotes that the finance ministry reckons are needed to restore liquidity to the economy is even trickier. In a best-case scenario, in which India's four banknote presses churned out new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes designed to replace the abolished ones, it would take at least three months to hit that target. Secrecy was paramount, but clues had been left. Back in April, analysts at State Bank of India said that demonetisation of large-denomination notes was possible. The Reserve Bank of India , the central bank, also disclosed in May that it was making preparations for a new series of banknotes that were confirmed in August when it announced it had approved a design for a new 2,000 rupee note. The printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started to run with the story in late October. "The plan was to introduce it around November 18, but there was a clear sign that it could get leaked," said one person with direct knowledge who, like others interviewed by Reuters, asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Some officials in the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high-value notes when the idea came up for discussion.  They now feel resentment at the secrecy in which Adhia rammed through the plan on Modi's orders. They also say the plan was flawed because of a failure to ramp up printing of new notes ahead of time. Other critics say the Adhia team fell prey to a form of "group think" that ignored outside advice. In the words of one former top official who has worked at the finance ministry and central bank: "They don't know what's happening in the real world. "

Centre has no plan to impose tax on farmers  -----  Dec 6, 2016, 05. 32 PM   -----  NAINITAL: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that there was no plan to impose tax on farmers for their produce or on women for their jewellery. Addressing a rally here as part of the BJP 's ongoing parivartan yatra, Prasad said the country was moving towards a cashless economy under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose demonetization move had made the rich bow to poor for the first time in the country. "Income tax wouldn't be imposed on farmers, neither is there any plan to impose tax on jewellery.  All sorts of rumours are being spread to mislead people.  But they should pay no attention to the rumours," the Union law and IT minister said. "We are moving towards a cashless economy under the leadership of Modi and demonetisation is a step in that direction," he said. Addressing the crowds, Prasad appealed to the public to maintain their patience and trust the government and not be influenced by any rumours. He said that no new taxes would be implemented on farmers and no new laws or taxes will be framed in relation to gold. Prasad clarified that the step towards demonetization was taken to make the Indian currency stronger and to eliminate black money from the market. He said that the general public was supporting the decision and it was only the opposition which had a problem with it. Even leaders across the globe have praised the move, he said. Prasad accused the opposition of diminishing the morale of the Army He said that while the families of the soldiers who died were happily willing to send their children in the Army, it was the opposition which was interfering with the Army. Prasad said that in the past two-and-half-years of the party rule, no minister has been accused of any corrupt practices while this was a trend during the Congress regime.

"Wherever I went, I asked the people - should corruption and black money be eliminated? Should the poor, neo-middle and middle class get their due? The answer I got everywhere was a resounding yes!"(With PTI Inputs)

Modi: Not a single Industrialist's loan waived after Modi govt came to power: Arun Jaitley  -----  Feb 14, 2017, 07. 50 PM   -----  LUCKNOW: In a direct reply to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi 's allegation that Modi government had waived of loans to big business houses, Union Finance and Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley said that it was a false allegation. "Though I am not used to using harsh words, I would say that what Rahul had been saying at various public meetings was completely away from truth," Jaitley said and added that such a big leader should not speak this way.  Rahul Gandhi should update his knowledge that the Modi government after coming to power on May 26, 2014 has not waived any loan to any big industrialist. What is true that loans were taken during 2006, 07 and 2008 and their interest has been increasing due to non-payment of the laons, Jaitley said. In the same vein, he also hit out at Akhilesh government for spreading false allegation that Centre has stopped state funds.  The state's share, which was 28 per cent earlier, was increased to 32 per cent and now it is 42 per cent, Jaitley said and added that since there is a simple maths that the state would get 42 per cent, it cannot be increased or decreased.  In fact no Central government can reduce that share, Jaitley said and added other than that Centre gives fund for various schemes like MNREGA etc. Jaitley, who was on a day-long visit to Lucknow, while replying to a quesiton at the press conference said that demonetisation should not be linked with the elections.  "It is part of our programme to clean the system and bring political reforms," Jaitley said and reiterated what he said in his budget speech: "A good cause never loses". The whole opposition was united against the decision of demonetisation while the common man has appreciated the demonetization move of the Modi government.  Hitting out at the SP government, Jaitley said that the Central government has allocated Rs 3. 96 lakh crores for the infrastructure and constructed 10,000 Km road in the country every year, on the other hand the SP Government is taking credit for one partially completed high way in the five years. Making an attack on the SP-Congress tie-up, Jaitley said that it is an alliance of compulsion.  In the past these Samajwadis were against Congress.  Lohiya was the first leader in 60s to give slogan "Congress hatao desh bachao (Remove Congress and save the country) .  However, the present Samajwadi Party has preferred dynasty over ideology and cheated the people. He said that there was a huge wave in favour of BJP in Uttar Pradesh.  The signs have been visible with the BJP winning many elections in the recent past, he said and added that it was a sign that the BJP was all set to form government in the state. Like national BJP chief Amit Shah, Jaitley also said that there was a triangular fight as was evident in the phase one with BSP also putting up fight at several seats in the West UP.

Congress's failure to unite opposition parties cheers BJP  -----  Dec 27, 2016, 03. 20 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Days before the end of the 50-day window sought by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to streamline banking services post demonetisation, the ruling BJP is upbeat over Congress 's failed bid to forge a united front of opposition parties against the currency ban. Senior party members said that while people of the country emerged as the actual soldiers in the fight against black money, parties opposing the move are seen as the "rallying point of negative politics".  BJP said Congress should have taken a cue from the "incident-free" transition after high denomination notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 were scrapped. "First people rejected Congress' opposition to demonetisation, followed by differences within the party.  Now even the opposition has rejected the Congress ploy to politicise a move, which is seen as key to historic reforms in the country," BJP national spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said on Monday. BJP members felt the "resilience" shown by people during the cash crunch has come as an endorsement of the decision and that barring a few stray incidents, the transition was smooth. PM Modi and BJP president Amit Shah have on several occasions acknowledged the patience displayed by people after demonetisation hit banking services, leading to long queues at ATMs and bank branches. Several opposition parties, including CPM, SP, NCP and JD(U) have decided to stay away from the opposition meeting called by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi "The opposition's boycott of the Congress meeting shows lack of leadership and accountability within Congress," Sharma said.  He said Congress and TMC had a negative agenda with their only goal being to block the development agenda of the Modi government.  "First they paralysed Parliament and later they tried to incite the public against demonetisation.  These parties had no constructive suggestion on any issue and they failed as opposition," he said.

demonetisation: Mamata Banerjee, Rahul Gandhi dare PM Modi to resign for 'failure of note ban'  -----  2020-11-01 00:00:00  -----  big step like demonetisation +
 
 what he calls +
 
 alleged list +
 
 Sheila Dikshit's name also features on that list +
 
 NEW DELHI: Trinamool leader Mamata Banerjee stole the show at a joint opposition press conference today and said that instead of making the country cashless, the Centre has made its own existence "baseless" and rendered itself "faceless" following the November 8 decision to scrap high-value currency notes. Banerjee dared PM Narendra Modi to resign saying that he had promised if the cash crunch situation doesn't improve in 50 days from demonetisation , he would personally answer for it.  And in a direct hit alleging the PM is authoritarian , Banerjee also said the government should have taken the Parliament into confidence before taking such a"Will you resign as the PM, if things don't get stable in 50 days, which is now almost over? What you've done (currency ban), has sent the country 20 years back in time," the West Bengal chief minister thundered at a joint press conference with the Congress party, the RJD and a few other parties that earlier held a joint meeting to discuss what could become a "common minimum agenda" to take on the Centre. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , who also addressed the press conference, focussed not just on demonetisation but also on"the personal corruption of the PM".  He was referring to PM Modi's name featuring on anof those who received kickbacks from industrial houses.  About the fact that his party colleague, Rahul said she's ready for an inquiry into it. "Sheilaji has said that she is ready for a probe, why is the PM not ready for a similar probe?" Rahul asked. While the Congress had hoped more opposition parties would join the meeting - the CPM and the NCP were among those who decided not to attend - Trinamool's Banerjee more than made up for their absence with her sound and fury. She brushed off the fact that some major parties didn't attend by saying "some political parties didn't come today because they're busy, but we will all make a common minimum agenda".  She was referring to an agenda to deal with the myriad problems that demonetisation has caused the poor, including most of the farming community, daily wage labourers, small businesses and even much of the lower middle class. "You promised 'acche din' (good days), is this a specimen of the 'acche din' you promised?" she asked the PM, referring to the BJP's election campaign slogan that talked of "bringing back 'acche din' after years of misrule. "Banerjee, in her address, was also her sarcastic best when describing what she thinks is the Centre's unilateral behaviour. "This is a fearless government, they do not care about anything, they don't fear anything," the Trinamool leader said.  Then, in case anyone didn't get her barb, she added: "They do whatever they feel like, the federal structure totally destroyed.  This is not (like the) Emergency, it is super-Emergency," she said. Congress leader Rahul imputed sinister motives to demonetisation.  He said the PM's stated aims of eradicating black money with demonetisation have been "a big failure" and alleged that the Centre had "ulterior motives" to scrap high value currency notes. "The PM needs to answer the nation regarding what the real objective was behind the note ban.  He said if things don't get better he will answer for it.  Things haven't got better.  Black money has not been erased; instead a new black market has come up to convert the money.  At the end of the day, like always, it's the poor that are suffering," the Congress leader said. Demonetisation is "an attack on the financial independence, of the poor," Rahul added. The Congress vice president also brought up the case of PM Modi's name featuring on a list that allegedly has names of those people who were paid off by the Birla group and the Sahara group in 2013. "The PM says he's against corruption, but when his own integrity is in question he doesn't answer.  He needs to tell the nation, considering all the problems he's putting citizens through," Rahul said.

Arun Jaitley: Arun Jaitley dares Congress: Spell out one UPA move to fight black money  -----  Dec 9, 2016, 10. 14 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley asked Congress to list any initiative that UPA took to curb black money , seeking to fight back against opposition protests on demonetisation as he replied to the discussion on supplementary demand for grants on Lok Sabha "I today challenge them (Congress) to spell out a single step that they had taken during 10-year of their rule against black money," Jaitley said on Thursday.  Lok Sabha passed the demand for grants in the din, after another tumultuous day of protests when the first half had to be adjourned twice. The House took up the grants for passage post lunch but the discussion and the reply from the finance minister was conducted amid slogans from opposition members, led by Congress and TMC, packed in the well.  Jaitley denied opposition's charge that the recent amendment to the Income Tax Act had provided an easy route to convert black money into white by paying 50% tax. He said the effective tax liability would be 65%, claiming the same was only 8% in the voluntary disclosure scheme brought in 1997.  Incidentally, one of the protest slogans during the discussion was "50:50 band karo". Of the additional public expenditure of about Rs 60,000 crore approved, Jaitley said MGNREGA would get an additional Rs 4,000 crore and the annual expenditure on the scheme would be Rs 47,000 crore.  "Although Congress made promises, they never made so much expenditure on the scheme," he claimed. According to Jaitley, before the NDA regime, India was considered one of the five "fragile" economies in the world, but it had since turned into a "bright spot" and was set to become the fastest growing large economy for the third year in a row.

demonetisation: Long bank weekend set to worsen cash crunch  -----  Dec 10, 2016, 09. 06 AM   -----  NEW DELHI/ LUCKNOW/MUMBAI: The cash crunch in many cities, including the national capital, showed no sign of easing on Friday, and with banks closed for the next three days, expect the pain to persist till Tuesday when they reopen for business.  Banks are shut on Monday for Eid-e-Milad. A majority of banks in the capital continued to grapple with cash shortages and restless customers.  "For the past three days, the supply has been uneven.  We run out of cash in the initial hours after opening," said a branch manager at a private bank.  The scene was the same across the country. A leading private bank in Delhi received Rs 24 crore against its daily normal requirement of Rs 125 crore.  A large chunk of ATMs in the capital remained idle due to lack of cash while some only had Rs 2,000 notes.  Long lines reappeared in front of some bank branches.  The frustration of those queued up was apparent considering the weekend is when people have time for outings. State-run banks fared better as they got a larger share.  Bankers said the shortage of Rs 500 notes continued despite the government and Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) assurance that the supply of new notes had been stepped up. According to an official with a private bank, the situation in Mumbai has improved in the last few days.  Compared to an average of Rs 25 crore, the flow of currency was Rs 60 crore.  On Friday, large private banks in Mumbai got around Rs 60 crore while it was Rs 25 crore in Delhi.  "We hope by next week, with increased supply of Rs 500 notes, we would get Rs 80 crore a day.  This will ease the pressure," said another private banker. In Uttar Pradesh, queues before bank branches and ATMs refused to shrink. Bankers complained that they were not getting adequate supply of currency from RBI.  Most ATMs across the state are dry while banks have imposed different withdrawal limits -from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 instead of the Rs 24,000 set by RBI.  And with three consecutive bank holidays lined up from Saturday , people across UP are bracing for a "dry" weekend. Most leading banks in Lucknow said that while the daily footfall for cash withdrawal in the first week of De cember increased three times, cash supply from RBI declined by almost 40%.  In Lucknow, around 85% of ATMs remained dry for a significant period of time, say bankers. A government bank's cash officer said, "Prior to demonetisation , our daily cash requirement was Rs 40-50 lakh but after November 9, daily demand rose to almost Rs 1. 5 crore as people have now started hoarding cash for emergencies.  On the other hand, RBI is providing only 40% of our daily requirement. " Banks are managing withdrawals from the valid currency deposited by customers. Postal officer held for cash fraudThe CBI on Friday arrested senior Indian Postal Service (IPoS) officer K Sudheer Babu and two others in the demonetised currency exchange fraud.  Babu was remanded to judicial custody on Friday while the other two will be produced before court on Saturday.  CBI is likely to register one more case against Sudheer and others on Saturday, taking the fraud amount from 2. 95 crore to about 4 crore.

Old notes deposited in banks will be closely scrutinized for tax liability, warns Arun Jaitley  -----  Dec 8, 2016, 08. 40 PM   -----  finance minister Arun Jaitley +
 
 government demonetised old Rs 500 and 1000 notes +
 
 measures to promote digital mode of payments +
 
 Jan Dhan bank accounts +
 
 NEW DELHI: With 76 per cent of the junked currency coming back into the banking system,on Thursday warned that mere depositing of old notes in banks will not change the money from 'black to white' and tax liability would remain on unexplained funds. Less than a month after thein its biggest step to fight black money , corruption and counterfeit currency, nearly Rs 11. 85 lakh crore out of the Rs 15. 44 lakh crore junked notes were back into the system. "I may only clarify that merely depositing money in the bank doesn't mean that it changes colour from black to white.  Its tax liability would still remain because what is unexplained would still remain taxable," he told reporters. At a briefing called to announce, he said money deposited in banks will be closely scrutinised to establish tax liability. "And therefore what is deposited in banks will be closely scrutinized to determine the tax liability on that money.  The mere fact that money is coming to banks doesn't make it to change colour," he said. The zero-balance, opened as part of financial inclusion campaign and to transfer government benefits, including subsidy, directly to beneficiaries, have seen Rs 36,809 crore of deposit in last four weeks even though the amount being deposited is now fast decelerating. Jaitley said the government campaign to incentivise people to go digital and shed cash to the extent possible is good for the economy. Asked if he would encourage political parties to accept donations in digital mode, he said it would inevitably be the future course. "If it becomes digital, if it becomes smaller donation, if it becomes lesser donation from a larger body of donors it will be a great day for Indian democracy," he said. The finance minister said he has been repeatedly stating that there is a cost of dealing in cash both to the economy and to the political system. "After all internationally if you have seen in large democracies, lakhs and millions of people donating small amounts online to political parties," he added.

 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday told ain Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich that 'gunda raj' will end in the state if his party is voted to power. The PM wasn't actually at the rally. His helicopter couldn't land in Bahraich due to low visibility caused by foggy weather.  But instead of cancelling the rally,"Today there is gundaraj in the state.  Everyone is fed up of this lawlessness.  Even the police is unable to stop the gundas," he said. "If you have to take your state forward, you will have to throw out those backing these gundas.  And the Bharatiya Janata Party will do that," PM Modi said, targeting the ruling Samajwadi Party The PM said he can't understand the discomfort of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at the central government's fight against black money. "They (SP and BSP) are seldom on the same page on an issue.  But nowadays, they are speaking in one voice.  I can't understand the reason for their discomfort at the fight against black money," he said. The PM also mentioned the crackdown on black money hoarders after"You must have seen that the government is after people who have stashed black money.  The government is committed to empowering the poor.  The people are also taking pain to ensure the country moves on the path of development. ," he said. He said that his fight against black money and graft would go on and all those hoarding unaccounted money would be caught in the coming days. PM Modi today also mentioned the logjam in the Parliament, which he said wasn't being allowed to function "by those very parties which have been discarded by the electorate. "He explained that the government was ready for a debate (on demonetisation) but that these parties weren't allowing it to present its viewpoint. "They (opposition) come to the Well of the House. . . throw paper at the Speaker.  We want to put forth the government's view point. . . but they are not allowing us to do so," he said. This was supposed to be PM Narendra Modi's third visit to Bahraich, and his first after he assumed charge as Prime Minister. He was national general secretary of the BJP when he visited Bahraich in 2001 for the first time, and later in November 2013 for the second time. A huge rally ground was prepared adjacent to the district headquarters of Bahraich to prepare for his visit. This is the PM's fifth Parivartan Rally in Uttar Pradesh, after mammoth rallies in Ghazipur, Agra, Kushinagar, and Moradabad.

In times of cashless economy, parties' cash in hand increases  -----  Dec 11, 2016, 06. 27 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: The demonetisation drive and the consequent opposition din in Parliament serve to highlight the opaque funding system of political parties that receive most of their funds in cash, deposit them in banks, and issue cheques for up to 90% of the money collected. TOI studied the latest audited accounts of the parties and found most to have plenty of cash in hand.  The cash in hand and bank balance of UP's ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) was Rs 583 crore as on March 31, 2016.  Its main rival BSP has a bank balance of Rs 514 crore.  While BSP collected all the funds from 'unknown donors', mostly in cash, SP too received the majority of its donations in cash and from contributors who don't find mention in any record book. The two leading national parties, BJP and Congress, too have, year-after-year, collected huge monies   the cash in hand and bank balance of BJP was Rs 653 crore and that of Congress Rs 601 crore as on March 31, 2015.  BJP and Congress have not filed audited accounts with the Election Commission (EC) for the financial year ending March 31, 2016, much beyond the deadline.  Congress has been reluctant to furnish the audited accounts, and wrote several times to the EC questioning its jurisdiction in implementing such transparency measures. Far from cleaning their stables, these parties are vigorously fighting it out in court to retain the right to receive contributions from unknown donors and claim tax exemptions too.  When Congress was detected with Rs 25 crore in unaccounted for money, an income made in 1994-95 for which it failed to explain the source to income tax authorities, the tax authorities withdrew its exemption.  The party then moved the Delhi high court and, after receiving an adverse judgment, moved the Supreme Court against it. The CPM too has a large bank balance of Rs 286 crore (as on March 31, 2016), and continues to collect cash.  According to an expenditure statement submitted by the party to the EC on July 3, its gross receipts during the assembly polls in West Bengal and Kerala (March-May 2016) were Rs 60 crore   almost 57% of this, or Rs 34 crore, was collected in cash.  But more than 68% of the party's total expenditure of Rs 32 crore was by way of cheque.  According to an analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms , an NGO working for electoral reforms, more than 60% of the total income of parties in 2014-15 was from unknown sources and in cash.  These parties have also refused to furnish any details to the I-T department as to who contributed this amount, merely putting them under the heads of "sale of coupons, relief fund, miscellaneous income, voluntary contributions and donations received during morchas". The source of about 50% of donations received by BJP (Rs 434 crore) in 2014-15 remains unknown.  In case of CPM, only 6% of Rs 59 crore came from known sources.  Rest of the donors are unknown and the party has not furnished any details, the ADR report said for accounts and I-T returns it analysed till 2015.  In case of Congress, the unknown donors were to the tune of 38% of the total contributions.

Arun Jaitley: Not all scrapped currency will be remonetised, hints Arun Jaitley  -----  Dec 17, 2016, 02. 58 PM   -----  digital currency +
 
 scrapping of old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes +
 
 Reserve Bank +
 
 NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley today hinted that not all of the Rs 15. 44 lakh crore worth of currency junked will be remonetised through issuance of new notes as he saidwill fill the gap. Calling theas "a courageous step", he said the government could do it as India today has the capacity to take such decisions and experiment boldly. The move will create a new Indian normal as the one that existed for the past seven decades is "unacceptable", he said, adding that demonetisation will help rid the economy of high cash circulation that had led to tax evasion, black money and currency being used for crime. "One of the efforts of this exercise has to be that even though a reduced cash currency could remain, our conscious effort. . .  (is) to supplement the rest with a digital currency," he said while addressing annual general meeting of industry chamber FICCI here. As many as 17,165 million pieces of Rs 500 denomination and 6,858 million pieces of Rs 1,000 banknotes were in circulation on November 8 when the government made the surprise announcement. Jaitley further said: "The whole process of remonetisation is not going to take very long time and I'm sure very soon theby injecting currency daily into the banking and postal system will be able to complete that. "Also, the push to use the digital mode to make payments has been gaining ground.  "The manner it has taken place in the last five weeks is indeed commendable.  Only a section of Parliament seems unaware of what is happening," he said. Once the remonetisation process is complete, it will mark "the creation of a new Indian normal because the normal that existed for 70 years is an unacceptable normal," he added. "The 70-year normal had become a way of life for almost every Indian.  It was not merely a fact that you had a lot more cash currency, far larger cash currency as part of your GDP. . .  the economic and social consequences of that are extremely adverse. "He made a point that dealing in that cash currency had led to a lot of aberrations in terms of tax non-compliance, currency being used for collateral purposes like crime, escaping the tax net and not getting into the banking system.

demonetisation: With Rs 9. 9 lakh crore back, Centre s estimates may go for a toss  -----  Dec 4, 2016, 09. 18 AM   -----  deadline to deposit invalidated 500 and 1,000 rupee notes +

 NEW DELHI: With over three weeks to go for the, deposits in the scrapped currency continue to swell, straining the Centre's estimate of how much of the illegal tender might not come back into the system. Government data shows deposits in two high denomination notes by Saturday evening had totalled Rs 9. 85 lakh crore.  The imposing figure, shared by sources on condition of anonymity, challenges the Centre's estimate that demonetisation might flush out about Rs 3 lakh crore in black money that may never come back.  With more cash sure to flow in before December 30 when the window closes, this figure might shrink. Sources said the government expected at least 10% of the Rs 14. 6 lakh crore to disappear for good: a prospect which would have reduced the RBI's liability and it could have passed on the money thus saved as dividend to the government. Sources feel the endless stream of deposits illustrate that those with illegal hordes have been able to find ways to convert "black" into deposits. PM Narendra.  Preliminary investigation has thrown up the curious pattern of a massive number of deposits of Rs 49,000, the threshold to avoid furnishing PAN number needed for deposits of Rs 50,000 and above. The Centre is aware of laundering on "industrial scale", and has responded by tweaking regulations   the biggest example being the changes in the Income Tax Act to provide for stiff penalty and tax on undeclared amounts now surfacing in accounts. is another example of what an official called improvisation triggered by the ingenuity of money launderers.  "This is a typical cat-and-mouse game; regulatory dialectics, if you will, which is playing out, with the Centre trying to keep ahead of those trying to game the system," said an official who referred to numerous instances where employers, including educational institutions and hospitals, put money into accounts of employees and have taken post-dated cheques as security. Sources said a substantial amount of black money will still be flushed out and this, coupled with what is expected to be realised by higher tax and penalty on undeclared cash, will help the Centre justify demonetisation. In fact, the Centre has already been shifting the focus from the destruction of black money to the amount the "corrupt" have been forced to part with.  Modi, who in his speeches in the immediate wake of demonetisation talked about notes flowing in Ganga,on Saturday when he spoke about the "endless flow" of money. Of course, his emphasis was on the "transfer of wealth" from the "corrupt" to the poor which came with his controversial advice to those with Jan Dhan accounts to hold on to what has been deposited in their accounts: a pitch that cast him as the architect of expropriation of a kind usually approved by Marxists.

The Taxation Laws (2nd Amendment)on Tuesday, providing a window to legalise black money after paying tax on the amount post-demonetisation.  As per the Bill, those who disclose black money to banks will have to, including surcharge and penalty. Asked about the walkout by the opposition MPs in the Lok Sabha, Rahul said, "There is a practice in Parliament that whenever someone dies we respect them.  This is for the first time that there was no such obituary offered for those soldiers who had died (in Nagrota attack).  So the Opposition walked out. "Opposition members walked out of the Lok Sabha as their demand for an obituary reference on the soldiers who died in the terror attack on army camp in Jammu was rejected by the Speaker on the grounds that final details were yet to emerge. Countering Rahul's charges, information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu said, "It is unfortunate that Congress is doing politics over the issue involving defence of the country. ""The Speaker informed that combing operations are underway in Nagrota.  Once operations are over, tribute will be paid in the House to the soldiers," he said. Taking on Congress, Naidu said, "People of the nation hate such small politics.  Congress party walked out during question hour and then came back.  Congress neither wants any discussion nor wants House to function as they are scared of being exposed.  It's an insult to Nagrota martyrs. "

demonetisation: Did you have a plan at all, Supreme Court asks govt about demonetisation move  -----  Dec 10, 2016, 07. 27 AM   -----  new currency +
 
 court's comments came as the Centre +
 
 NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday fired a series of sharp and critical questions about demonetisation at the Centre, asking if it had a plan at all or took a decision "just like that" when it scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8. Responding to attorney general Mukul Rohatgi's submission that the Centre's expectation that scrapped currency worth Rs 10-11 lakh crore would come back had been exceeded, the court caustically asked, "Can you put what you had estimated when you took the decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes? Did you make any estimation at all? Was there a plan? Or, did you take the decision just like that? If you had thought notes worth Rs 10 lakh crore would come back to the banks, did you take steps to urgently put in that much ofback in circulation? Can you produce the Cabinet note before the decision was taken?"Thesaid deposits of old notes had touched Rs 12 lakh crore till date but resisted the SC's attempts to tweak the withdrawal limit to provide relief for harassed citizens by asking, "Can you tinker with fiscal policy?"The bench persisted and asked the Centre to revert by Wednesday whether it intends to rework a cash withdrawal limit to make it possible for banks to honour it and not ask citizens to downsize their demand citing insufficient cash.  The court's remarks came in the context of submissions that banks were rationing cash and not honouring the Rs 24,000 withdrawal limit. The court also asked if the government would permit cooperative banks to receive deposits under stringent guidelines in response to pleas that this was essential to meet the needs of the farm sector.  The SC further sought the Centre's response whether it supported sending the petitions challenging demonetisation to a five-judge bench as demanded by former minister and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal. Rohatgi told a bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, "We had initially expected Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes worth Rs 10-11 lakh crore to be deposited back in banks.  It has exceeded our expectation.  80% of the scrapped notes have come back.  We expect one or two more crores to trickle in by December 31. "Rohatgi pushed back and articulated the Centre's apprehension over the judiciary scrutinising fiscal policy and attempting to tweak it.  "There is serious reservation about maintainability of these PILs filed by advocates and cooperative banks against demonetisation.  Can the SC decide fiscal policy of a government? Can it dictate what should be done and what should not be? "The judiciary has stepped into the realm of fiscal policy.  Can the court decide what should be the government's fiscal policy? It is not permissible.  Please think about this.  The situation is getting better and it will normalise after December 31. Which farmer or poor person has come to the court asking for relief or complaining about non-availability of cash? Most of the PILs are filed by lawyers and cooperative banks.  Do lawyers represent the people?" the AG asked. Former finance minister and senior advocate P Chidambaram claimed the government did not have a correct estimate of what would return to the banks.  He said that as of November 1, there were Rs 15. 44 lakh crore worth of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.  "The government had no proper estimate of what would come back to banks post-demonetisation.  It has put new currency notes worth Rs 3 lakh crore into the system.  As a result, there is a severe cash crunch and people still have to stand for hours before banks and ATMs.  Yet, there is no guarantee that they will get money," he said.

Fully cashless economy not possible in India, says MoS for finance  -----  Dec 17, 2016, 10. 35 PM   -----  BAREILLY: At a time when the Centre is promoting cashless transactions with rewards and incentives, Union minister of state for finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Saturday admitted that it was not possible for India to become a fully cashless economy "We understand that a fully cashless economy is not possible in our country.  The more number of people opting for cashless transactions, the more it is beneficial for the country.  We believe that even if 15-20% of the population starts doing cashless transactions, it will be a positive step for us," said Gangwar while talking to TOI at his home on Saturday.  "There are more than 100 crore mobile phones in the country and people are trying to learn its use for cashless transactions," he added. For encouraging digital mode of transactions in the country, National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, the government's policy think-tank, on Thursday had announced a lottery with daily, weekly and mega awards for consumers and merchants.  The awards will be offered through two schemes - the Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana for merchants at an estimated cost of Rs 340 crore.  The first lucky draw will be on December 25 and it has been termed as a 'Christmas gift'.  The mega lucky draw would be on April 14, the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar. Reiterating that demonetization is a historical decision taken against black money, Gangwar said, "As we are taking back currency worth Rs 16 lakh crore, it is natural that some problem will crop up.  It is true that only half of the total currency has been introduced in the market but people are still supporting the government.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought time for 50 days to streamline things.  I visited a few places and found that queues outside banks and ATMs have become shorter.  Changes will be visible soon. "

demonetisation: Government is now 'experimenting on us, to try and prove itself correct', Robert Vadra says  -----  Dec 20, 2016, 02. 13 PM   -----  scrapping high-value notes +
 
 only deposit Rs 5,000 in scrapped notes +
 
 firebombing of the 99 per cent of honest people +
 
 NEW DELHI: Accusing the government of "experimenting on us, to try and prove itself correct", Robert Vadra , son-in-law of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, today slammed the Centre for, and worse, for constantly changing the rules. Vadra's comments came a day after the RBI, in yet another rule change since November 8, said that people can nowand do that only once until December 30.  Further, the RBI said that those depositing more than Rs 5,000 in scrapped currency notes will be scrutinised and questioned.  All this, despite the Centre initially - when announcing demonetisation on November 8 - allowing the deposit of old notes totaling any amount, until December 30. "For how long & how much more will the Government experiment on us, to try & prove itself correct? Now, deposits of more than Rs  5,000 of demonetised currency note, will be allowed only once, till December 30 & that too with an explanation," Vadra asked in a Facebook post. Yesterday the RBI said that anyone depositing above Rs 5,000 will be questioned "on record, in the presence of at least two officials of the bank, as to why this could not be deposited earlier" and only after a "satisfactory explanation" will the money be deposited. For Vadra, this move smacks of excess. "It (the government) has turned financial institutes (in)to interrogation offices.  Sad to see people suffering due to whims & fancies of the govt.  I feel for the people and their difficulties they have n are facing," Vadra said referring to the move to "question" people about deposits higher than Rs 5,000. The Congress and most opposition parties have also come out against the note ban Last week, Vadra's brother-in-law and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said demonetisation wasn't a 'surgical strike' on black money - as the government has claimed - it was a 'firebombing' on Indians, the overwhelming majority of whom are honest.  Narendra Modi got up on November 8 and announced that the money which is in your pocket has now turned into mere paper," Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Fatorda. "This not a surgical strike on black money but it isof India. "Rahul said demonetisation was akin to 200-300 aircraft "firebombing" cities during World War II, destroying them completely within 25 minutes. "The impact of firebombing was far worse than the atom bomb.  Narendra Modi has done similar fire-bombing through demonetisation and burnt entire India," he said.

Currency crisis: Let people use old notes for necessities, says Supreme Court  -----  Dec 16, 2016, 01. 31 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court questioned the Centre on Thursday on the way it had handled the aftermath of demonetisation and asked why there was unequal distribution of new currency notes among people. Indirectly pointing towards recent raids in which people were caught with stash of new notes, a bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said that demonetisation had resulted in a "problem of extreme", with a few people managing to get plenty of notes while others struggled to get a single one. The court was also of the view that scrapped currency notes should be allowed to be used by people to access basic necessities of life.  It said the old notes should be accepted in government hospital so that people could avail medical facilities.  "What is your apprehension if government hospitals are allowed to accept scrapped notes? Why should people suffer if you are not able to supply new notes to them?" the bench asked and reserved its order. Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said that the inconvenience faced by people would soon be over and the court should not pass an interim order for use of scrapped currency. He said that the government had decided that Rs 8,000 crore which was collected by district cooperative banks between November 11 and 14 would be accepted by RBI, and banks could exchange the scrapped notes. The AG said black money and unaccounted cash would come back into circulation if the court allowed use of scrapped notes.  He said huge sums of black money were converted into white when scrapped notes were allowed at petrol pumps and for railway reservation and there were chances that it would be repeated. Rohatgi said that the government had taken a bold decision which no other dispensation took during the last 70 years and the situation would soon become normal. "We have only 14 days left.  The idea behind demonetisation was to root out black money and the government has been able to achieve its target.  This country is witnessing a revolution.  No other government dared to do so earlier.  The government has taken a decision and its answerable to Parliament," he said. The bench, however, drew the AG's attention to the problems faced by common people and indicated that it may pass an interim order to reduce their inconvenience.  The court asked how huge amounts in new notes were recovered from bank officials and asked the AG about the government policy on supplying new currency notes to different bank branches

Will fight 'Kaala Dhan' and 'Kaala Mann'  -----  Dec 27, 2016, 07. 45 PM   -----  One Rank One Pension +
 
 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today again took aim at demonetisation's critics saying that he is "fighting not just " kaala Dhan " (black money) but also "kaala mann" (black heart). "You not only made me the Prime Minister (of India) but also the watchman and now some people are not comfortable that I am doing my job", PM Modi said in an address at the BJP's Parivartan rally in Dehradun .  He was referring to opposition parties' leaders, many of whom are highly critical of the PM's snap decision Novembe 8 to scrap high-value currency notes. Modi added that it is the honest people who are determined to fight corruption and therefore put up with the short-term problems of demonetisation. ""Most people are for honesty and they are being trampled.  We have waged this war to empower those who are being trampled", the PM said. "Corruption has destroyed the country, which was once called a 'sone ki chidiya' (very prosperous).  If the country is to progress, this plunder has to stop, corruption has to stop.  Despite facing lot of problems, the nation came forward to fight against corruption," the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also said that scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has hit funders of terrorism, drug runners, fake currency smugglers and human traffickers. "With just one move on November 8, the worlds of terrorism, drug mafia, human trafficking and fake note smuggling were destroyed," Modi said. "We promised that the corrupt will be punished and now this is happening.  This is a Safai Abhiyaan and people of India have helped me," he said. In a veiled attack on the Gandhi family and the Congress over the(OROP) issue, PM Modi said previous governments didn't care about soldiers. "My Army jawans (soldiers) were demanding OROP for the last 40 years, the party that ruled the country then never thought of their demands.  In reality, the budget for OROP is over Rs 10,000 crore.  Why did they (Congress) betray the Jawans? I salute my Army jawans.  Rs 6600 crore have already been disbursed under OROP and rest will also be disbursed at the earliest," PM Modi said. Earlier in the day, PM Modi also laid the foundation stone of the 900-km-long Char Dham Highway Development Programme in Dehradun, which will be built with an investment of Rs 12,000 crore. "I assure you that whenever you will come for Kedarnath, Badrinath yatra, you will remember this government like Shravan is remembered," PM said while dedicating the Char Dham project to the victims of the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand

ATMs closer to pre-Nov 8 cash position  -----  Jan 17, 2017, 02. 54 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Demonetisation seems to have changed the way consumers withdraw money from ATMs, straining the cash dispensing machines at a time when they are yet to start getting their full quota of cash. Industry sources said that compared to pre-demonetisation days when there were an average 125 withdrawals from each of the nearly 2. 2 lakh ATMs, the number has gone up as account holders are using multiple debit cards to stash money at home.  This is despite the government raising the withdrawal limit to Rs 4,500 a day (and to Rs 10,000 now).  The average withdrawal amount at one go was around Rs 3,500 before Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's decision to do away with old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. "With the withdrawal limits rising, account holders are now preferring to go to ATMs instead of going to bank branches where the formalities are more.  Things are slowly returning to normal as more cash is coming into the system," said a source. Estimates suggest that around Rs 7,000 crore is now flowing into ATMs every day, compared to over Rs 8,000 crore in pre-demonetisation days.  At the peak of the cash crunch - when there were long queues outside branches and ATMs - banks were making just around Rs 2,000 crore available for dispensing through the cash vending machines. Sources said that in pre-demonetisation days, cash logistics firms would typically refill around 1. 25 lakh ATMs every day (although the busy ones required more than one refill daily) and the number now is between 1. 1 lakh and 1. 25 lakh a day.  "Until the middle of December, 20-25% of the ATMs were working.  But a month down the line, things are inching towards normalcy in terms of refilling," an industry source said. With more money being printed at the currency presses, the situation has certainly eased.  Estimates suggest that around Rs 9 lakh crore has been pumped into the system through new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, and Rs 1-1. 25 lakh crore was available with currency chests across the country.  In all, Rs 15. 44 lakh crore had been sucked out of the system through demonetisation and the estimates suggest that close to 60% of the cash is back in the system. As a result, demand still outstrips supply, resulting in several bank customers not getting their full entitlement of Rs 24,000 a week.

Two persons, allegedly involved in exchange of money on a commission basis, were also nabbed by the police. Officials while giving details of the incident in Karnataka said the I-T department seized the alleged undisclosed assets, as part of its raids against black money hoarders post-demonetisation, from the residence of the said hawala operator who is yet to be identified. The Challakere town, about 40 km from district headquarters of Chitradurga, is popularly known as the 'oil city' due to number of edible oil mills being present there. Officials said the taxman raided the premises based on intelligence inputs about the presence of huge cash and the sleuths were startled to find a cleverly-hidden stainless steel safe, above the wash basin, inside the tiled walls of the bathroom. The cash stash of Rs 5. 7 crore, all in new Rs 2,000 notes, 28 kg of bullion (gold biscuits), 4 kg of other gold and jewellery was stuffed inside this bathroom safe, which was kept sanitised against termites using hundreds of mothballs. The assets were recovered after the department's investigation wing in Panaji on Friday began searches against casino and bullion traders in Hubballi and Chitradurga districts. A good number of documents and another Rs 90 lakh cash (Rs 100/20 notes) have been seized after the searches on the said hawala dealer, they said. "The searches in this case are still going on at various places and the valuation of the bullion and jewellery is being conducted," they said. Regarding the incident in Tamil Nadu, Officials said the fresh seizure of new currency, in Rs 2000 notes, was made by the sleuths from a car in Vellore on the insistence of the accused presently being interrogated in the case. With this amount, the total seizure in the case has now gone upto Rs 166 crore in a single case. The department had seized Rs 142 crore undisclosed assets - that includes about Rs 10 crore in new notes and gold bars weighing 127 kg -- during searches at multiple locations in Chennai, for the last two days, to check tax evasion. This largest seizure of new currency notes after the old Rs 500/1,000 notes were scrapped on November 8, took place after raids were launched on Thursday on eight premises of a group engaged in sand mining in Tamil Nadu. In a statement, the CBI said K Sudheer Babu, the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, had kept the amount of Rs 65 lakh as his commission for allegedly exchanging over Rs 3. 75 crore of old currency with the new one. "The money seized was the commission of K Sudheer Babu, as he kept it aside as his share, out of Rs 3. 75 crore, which he misappropriated by fraudulently exchanging old currencies for new currencies from the post offices falling under his division.  So far CBI had seized Rs 92. 68 lakh of new currency in Rs 2000 denomination, in these cases," it said.

 NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi defendedon Tuesday and took a sharp dig at Rahul Gandhi , saying thefinally arrived when tremors shook north India on Monday night. Replying to the debate on the President's address in the Lok Sabha , Modi reminded Congress of Rahul's claim last November that he would make sensational revelations on demonetisation that would cause an earthquake. "But finally the earthquake did come.  I was wondering why the quake came when it did.  The threat was given a long time ago.  There must be some reason that mother earth was so angry ," the PM said. Modi also cited Rahul's response to his jibe that.  Rahul had said it stood for, courage, ability and modesty . "How can someone see sewa or a virtue in a scam?" the PM asked.  Rahul had claimed that he has evidence of the PM's "personal corruption" -a reference to diaries and loose papers alleging payoffs to politicians recovered from two corporate offices.  The SC has since rejected a plea to treat the papers as evidence and said there was no case for a court-monitored investigation. Apart from political attacks that brought the fierce electoral contest in UP to the Lok Sabha, the PM used his speech to offer comparisons with UPA, arguing that his government had implemented Congress's pet schemes more effectively .  He said the savings accrued by reducing leakages and corruption through the use of the Aadhaar biometric identity system had resulted in thousands of crores being transferred to the poor and needy . He sought to link demonetisation with the unease of the "rich", and said, "I know a lot of big people are feeling uncomfortable. . .  More such measures are going to follow. " He also brought up the surgical strike on terror launch pads in POK and said, "The surgical strike was such a big success and I know it is troubling you (the opposition) but your problem is that you cannot say so in public. "Modi countered criticism that demonetisation had slowed a growing economy, saying only a strong economy could have taken the shock of the policy designed to weed out black money . The strident defence of demonetisation is significant in the backdrop of Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul making the note ban a key campaign point against BJP in the UP campaign. The government also defended demonetisation in the Rajya Sabha, where HRD minister Prakash Javadekar termed it a move to cleanse India of black money while the opposition accused the Centre of ignoring the woes of the poor and farmers.  Javadekar said the party "which made people stand in queues for over 50 years for even basic things. . . was now crying hoarse over demonetisation".

PM Modi thinks of next generation, Rahul Gandhi looks at disrupting next Parliament session, Arun Jaitley says  -----  Jan 8, 2017, 05. 58 PM   -----  All reforms are disruptive +
 
 cleaner economy +
 
 NEW DELHI: Two months into the ban on high-value currency, the once serpentine queues outside banks "have disappeared", claimed finance minister Arun Jaitley in a Facebook post today. As well, the fact that there was no social unrest during this "inconvenient" period shows that "an overwhelmingly large percentage of people have supported the centre's decision" to take out of circulation Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the minister added. "It (note ban) is obviously disruptive. .  They change the retrograde status quo.  The demonetisation puts a premium on honesty and penalises dishonest conduct. . .  (Therefore, those opposing it have) sided with the black money friendly status quo," Jaitley said. Those sentences formed the crux of Jaitley's post - sweeping reform will lead to a cleaner economy and anyone criticising it is moribund, a Luddite and corrupt.  And he may have titled his post 'Demonetisation - A look back at the last two months', but the short essay was equal parts crystal grazing and equal parts a defense of the various inconveniences people have faced since the note ban came into effect November 8, 2016. About criticism that PM Modi takes "unilateral decisions" Jaitley said there's "a marked difference in the approach" of the PM and his opponents. "The Prime Minister was being futuristic, and thinking of a more modern, technology driven.  He is now speaking of cleaning the political funding systems.  His opponents want a cash dominated, cash generating and cash exchange system to continue.  The difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi was clear - the Prime Minister was thinking of the next generation while Rahul Gandhi was only looking at how to disrupt the next Session of Parliament," said Jaitley not pulling any punches. Jaitley addressed the criticism that the note ban led to acute cash shortages which in turn affected growth. "Drop in economic activity on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period would have (only) a transient impact on the economy. . .  When 86% of a country's currency constituting 12. 2% of its GDP, is squeezed out of the market and sought to be replaced by a new currency, there would obviously be significant consequences of that decision," he said. The minister said this "transient impact" is a necessary step toward a cashless economy as well a tax-compliant one, with benefits for all.  Cash, he said, is evil.  It "funds bribery, corruption, counterfeit currency and terrorism. ""Paper currency is a zero interest anonymous bearer bond.  It has no name or history attached to it.  Crime can take place with or without cash but excessive cash as a medium of exchange is favoured by the underground economy.  It results in non-compliance in the matters of tax payments which creates an unjust enrichment in favour of the evader as against the poor and the deprived," he wrote. The predominance of cash also leads to tax evasion, or, 'the old normal', Jaitley said. "Expenditure required for poverty eradication, national security and economic development have to be compromised with on account of tax non-compliances.  For seven decades the Indian "normal" has been to undertake transactions partly in cash and partly in cheque.  'Pucca' and 'Kachha' accounts are a part of the business language.  Tax evasion has been considered as neither unethical nor immoral.  It was just a way of life.  Several Governments have allowed this "normal" to continue even though this compromised with larger public interest.  The Prime Minister's decision is intended to create a new 'normal' " Jaitley said. As for the note ban leading to huge problems for farmers, daily wagers and the lower middle class, Jaitley took their silence to mean consent. "There was no social unrest while implementing such a major decision.  All opinion polls conducted by independent media organizations have shown that an overwhelmingly large percentage of people have supported the Government's decision," Jaitley said. He said "the opposition disrupted a full Session of Parliament" for no reason and ineffectually. "Their exaggerated claims on the disruption of the economy have proved wrong," he said. Now, there are only good things to look forward to, Minister Jaitley claimed. "The period of pain and inconveniences is getting over.  Economic activity is being restored.  The banks today admittedly have a lot more money available in order to lend for growth.  Since this money constitutes low cost deposits with the banks, it is bound to bring down the rate of interest.  Both these things have already happened.  Lakhs of crores, which were floating in the market as lose currency, have now entered the banking system. "Here is Jaitley's entire post:

Amit Shah: Amit Shah pushes for less-cash economy  -----  Dec 16, 2016, 04. 37 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Disregarding opposition's escalating protests, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday firmed up the party's stance on the demonetisation move as he exhorted office-bearers including national executives and state in-charges to intensify a countrywide campaign to support demonetisation and government's push to popularise a 'less-cash' economy. "Mandate for the BJP was not for minor changes but for a holistic transformation which required a strong political will and decisiveness that PM Narendra Modi has displayed by the demonetisation move," Shah said. The strong stance came amid assessment by BJP's opponents that inconvenience resulting from cash squeeze and fears of large scale job loss might help them put the ruling party on the defensive.  Shah assured party office-bears that the opposition to demonetisation was confined to opposition parties and that people have full faith in the PM. "My dream is to see that maximum patents in the world are registered in the name of the country's youth," said Shah. Since demonetisation was announced, senior BJP members including PM Modi and Shah have referred to the youth, who could aid in expediting digitisation of the economy, the ultimate goal of demonetisation. "Demonetisation is a visionary decision of political will aimed at curbing black money and corruption.  Parties criticising it are doing so out of political malice.  We will not remain confined to small reforms but bring about fundamental changes in the economy," Shah told the meeting of office-bearers.  A senior party member quoted Shah as saying that it was imperative to kill the parallel economy running on black money to boost the country's resources. BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said the office-bearers shared ground feedback on demonetisation.  "People have appreciated the move and the feedback is encouraging.  Villagers and farmers are happy," he said following the meeting. Shah also used the occasion to direct party workers to encourage awareness about the ease of digital transactions, emphasising that 80 million cards were already in use. He took feedback from office-bearers over the action taken on proposals mooted in the previous national executive meeting as BJP prepares for the next executive meeting to be held in Delhi in January.

RBI raises cash withdrawal limit from ATMs to Rs 10,000 per day from current Rs 4,500  -----  Jan 17, 2017, 04. 38 AM   -----  MUMBAI: Cash-starved citizens can heave a sigh of relief.  The RBI has enhanced cash withdrawal limits from ATMs and current accounts with immediate effect.  Customers can now withdraw Rs 10,000 per day from automated teller machines against Rs 4,500 earlier, and current account holders can take out Rs 1 lakh a week at bank branches; their earlier limit was Rs 50,000. But the weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 24,000 from savings accounts will continue. The RBI's biggest relaxation on cash withdrawals, communicated to all banks on Monday, comes 70 days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and limits were placed on cash withdrawals. Banks have responded to the move positively.  "The overall limits have not been changed.  So account holders will be making fewer trips to the ATM for withdrawal," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, SBI.  A senior official with a private bank said that he did not foresee any problems because of the higher limits.  It could also mean less pressure on bank branches, but banks would still want to keep a watch on account holders' behaviour to learn about the impact of the new announcement. ATM operators have a different story to tell.  They say that they are facing a strange problem where even though only 60-70% of cash requirements are being met, customers are not withdrawing from ATMs.  These machines stock notes of only Rs 2,000 denomination since Rs 500 notes are still in short supply.  "The supply of currency in absolute terms has definitely improved, but the challenge now is the availability of lower denomination notes, like Rs 500.  We have a large number of ATMs that are stuffed with the Rs 2000 currency notes and there are no transactions at these ATMs," said Himanshu Pujara, MD, Euronet Services India-one of the companies that manage ATMs in the country. "The average withdrawal per cardholder was around Rs 3,500.  What is the point of increasing the withdrawal limit when only 60-70% of the ATMs are getting money? If supply of cash does not improve, ATMs will dry up sooner," said Mani Mamallan, founder and MD of Electronic Payment and Services, another ATM operator.

Rs 2000 notes a stop-gap arrangement: RSS ideologue Gurumurthy  -----  Dec 12, 2016, 11. 16 PM   -----  NEW DELHI: Introducing Rs 2000 notes is a stop-gap arrangement for the immediatepost-demonetisation scenario, RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy said today in New Delhi. Asked why the Rs 2,000 note was brought in and that it could encourage black money, Gurumurthy said, "In the short time of two months you do not have time to print Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.  This 2000 rupee note must be phased out . . .  Demonetisation is not a one-stop solution for blackmoney.  This requires a very major agenda. . .  The nation is rebooting. "Demonetisation decision is the equivalent of 'Financial Pokhran', he said today, visualising a paradigm shift in economy that will begin a process of bringing down real estate prices and encourage transparency. Terming the demonetisation a "Financial Pokhran", Gurumurthy said when people have excess cash there is always an urge to buy things which are not necessary and that leads to "irresponsible and heartless spending".  Demonetisation would bring about a huge change. "Just like Pokhran brought about a change which was unimaginable.  Who would have thought America would look at India.  If you had not exploded atom bomb they won't have looked at you. . . . "That is why post-Pokhran India is a paradigm shift likewise this 'Financial Pokhran' is a paradigm shift but it requires a very different mind to understand, articulate this and make people understand," he said. India conducted nuclear tests at Pokhran in 1998 that catapulted the country into a select nuclear club. Referring to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's comment that demonetisation was a "monumental mismanagement" that might dent GDP by 2 per cent, Gurumurthy said the demonetisation move undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a correction for the "monumental mismanagement of the economy by the UPA government from 2004", and if not now, demonetisation would have "remained undoable" in near future. Gurumurthy, who is also the co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an RSS-affiliate, said demonetisation was planned two months after the change of guard at the Reserve Bank, and it was implied that there would be some errors in implementing the decision in short time while maintaining secrecy. He said blackmoney is a psychological disease which has to be changed and also requires cleansing of the corrupt income tax department. "So far as the Rs 14 lakh crore has come into the banking system, many people may declare and pay tax may be Rs 20,000-30,000 crore tax may come in.  Others may conceal tax and put money in Jan Dhan accounts.  Governments will chase them," Gurumurthy said. He said for generating this amount of black money in the system it would take another 10 years and the government will do a "definite follow up" action to not let black economy prosper. "Organising the unorganised economy is what will happen through this," he said, adding that demonetisation would put a break to the black money.

action against a cooperative bank:  Heat on Munde-led bank shows govt s intent to act tough on cash stashers   -----  Dec 25, 2016, 04. 43 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: The CBI action against a cooperative bank , controlled by BJP's 'Munde family' in Maharashtra, has sent a strong message about PM Narendra Modi 's insistence that no violator would be spared in the government's efforts to cleanse the economy post demonetisation , party members say. Sources said the PM and BJP chief Amit Shah have been personally monitoring compliance of their instructions to BJP lawmakers to maintain transparency about their transactions after November 8.  Sources said the PMO cell, set up for calls against illicit monetary transactions and currency conversions, has helped agencies arrest a large number of violators since Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were scrapped. The CBI registered a case on Friday against two officials of a bank controlled by BJP MP Pritam Munde and some others, following recovery of Rs10 crore in demonetised notes last week.  The agency carried out searches at 11 places at Beed, Aurangabad, Pune and Mumbai.  However, nobody has been arrested so far. On December 15, police had recovered Rs 10. 10 crore, including Rs10 lakh in new Rs 2,000 notes, from a car in Maharashtra.  It turned out that Rs 10 crore of this was part of the Rs 25 crore in demonetised notes that the officials of Vaidyanath Urban Co-op Bank Ltd were transporting.  Pritam Munde is director of the bank . Action against the Munde family followed raids by the I-T department last week at eight premises of BJP member and former chairman of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Sahakari Awas Sangh, Sushil Vaswani, unearthing unaccounted cash in crores   in both old and new currency.  Income-tax officials had found discrepancies in transactions through Mahanagar Nagrik Sehkari Bank at Bairagarh, where Vaswani is a director and founder-member. A senior party leader said action against the two ruling party lawmakers testifies that Modi and Shah mean business and that days of immunity for ruling party leaders are over. "There should not be any exceptions while enforcing law of the land.  Unlike Congress, our party believes in setting example for others as we can't expect from people what we can't do," he said.

Govt helping cash hoarders with I-T Act change: Congress  -----  Nov 30, 2016, 04. 24 AM   -----  NEW DELHI: Congress accused the Modi government on Tuesday for facilitating black money holders by reducing the penalty on unaccounted wealth from 132% to 50% through the amendment in the Income Tax Act Attacking Modi for bringing yet another scheme to "help black money hoarders legally convert their money", AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, "The truth is that Narendra Modi is trying to give protection to black money holders and is devising new ways and means to do so. "Surjewala said Modi first brought out a 'fair and lovely' scheme from June 1 to September 30 under which black money could be converted to white by paying 45% tax and then announced the "Tughlaqi decision of demonetisation ". "Now another new scheme under the name of 'black money holder welfare scheme' has been brought.  The reality is that the tax penalty of 132% under section 271-I-C of IT Act has now been brought down to 50%," he added. Slamming the government for rushing through I-T amendments, he said bringing the money bill in the Lok Sabha and getting it passed amid din without holding a discussion amounted to "trampling of democracy" and was a "complete affront" on the authority of Parliament and the Constitution.  The opposition party dubbed the PM's call to party legislators to submit bank account details as yet another 'jumla' (gimmick) and dared him to make public all financial and land dealings of BJP and RSS in the last six months. Surjewala, along with party member Sushmita Dev, said Modi's move is also an attempt to deflect public attention from the alleged leakage of demonetisation.
